I have had a lot of mail about this problem over the years.  Some people question the answer, and some admit the answer is right, but that the solution is wrong.  Here is my original solution: For n points choose any given point and evaluate the \nprobability that the other n-1 lie within a semicircle \ngoing clockwise.  This probability is (1/2)n-1. To prove at least the answer is correct, I did ten million trials for various numbers \nof points on the circle.  I assumed the circle to have 32,767 \nunits or degrees.  The first point was defined to be at a halfway \npoint, or 16,383.  Then a maximum and minimum were taken for the rest of \nthe points.  If the difference between the maximum and minimum were \nless than 16,383 then the trial was considered to \nbe a success.  Note that 16,383 is half of 32,767, rounded down.  \nBecause of the rounding we should expect a slightly lower number \nof successes.  Here are the results: Problem 1 Solution Several people have written, saying my answer is right, but the solution is wrong.  Here is what David Beim of Columbia University wrote to me about it: There is no doubt that your answer is right, but your reasoning is unsettling because it confounds ex ante with ex post information.  We cannot construct the semicircles until the n points have been selected, and then it is too late to determine ex ante probabilities.  This kind of mixing can lead to all kinds of paradoxes in probability, as I am sure you know better than I.  For one simple example, select a point on a line.  Ex ante, the probability of selecting that point is zero; ex post, the probability must have been greater than zero because it happened. I attach my own solution (PDF 33K) to the problem, in case it is of interest.  Incidentally, I would give this problem four stars rather than three --took me days to get it clear! Per his comment, I did add a star to the difficulty level, it was 3 starts until November, 2008. This problem has been published in book form in \"Contests in Higher Mathematics\" by Gabor Szekely, which is a collection of math problems given to the best mathematicians of Poland over the last several decades.  The problem (1963 problem 10) is stated as, \"Select n points on a circle independently with uniform distribution.  Let Pn be the probability that the center of the circle is in the interior of the convex hull of these n points. Calculate the probabilities P3 and P4.  I'm told the answer agrees with mine."}

Later, at 6:00am, a snow plow sets out to clear a straight street. The plow can remove a fixed volume of snow per unit time, in other words its speed it inversely proportional to the depth of the snow. If the plow covered twice as much distance in the first hour as the second hour, what time did it start snowing? The distance covered in the first hour is the integral from \nx to x+1 of 1/t dt.  The antiderivative of 1/t is ln(t) so \nthe total distance covered in the first hour is ln((x+1)/x). By the same reasoning the distance covered in the second \nhour in ln((x+2)/(x+1)). Using the fact that it the plow traveled twice as \nfar in the first hour as the second:  ln((x+1)/x) = ln((x+2)/(x+1))2 Exp both sides and you have (x+1)/x = ((x+2)/(x+1))2.

Business A gets to choose a location first, then business B, then C, and finally D. Each business desires to carve out as much business for themselves as possible but each knows the others all have the same motive. Assume that if a business is indifferent between locating in two different sections of the circle it will choose a section at random. Also assume that the business that goes last will choose a location in the middle of the largest (or one of the largest) sections. Where should business B choose relative to the location of A? Business C will also choose the midpoint of the larger of the two gaps between the \nfirst two businesses.

Think of this problem instead as a random walk along the number line, starting at zero.  If the walker ever returns to zero, then success is achieved.  Let xi be the probability of success from point i on the number line.  Let p be the probability that the walker moves to the right.  Let's also let p be the lesser of the probabilities of flipping heads and tails. I hope I won't have to prove that x-1=1.  In other words, the gravity of the greater probability of q will pull the walker to the right, over the long run.  So if his first move is to the left, he will eventually make it back to point 0.  For the same reason, given a casino game with a house advantage, the house always wins in the long run.  If the player wins his first bet, if he plays indefinitely, he will eventually lose it back. That said, we can set up the following equations: x0 = p + q×x1\nx1 = p + q×x2\nx2 = p×x1 + q×x3\nx3 = p×x2 + q×x4\n.\n.\n. Next, take the sum of both sides. Let E = x0 + x1 + x2 + ... E = 2p + pE -p×x0 + qE - q×x0\nE = 2p + E×(p+q) - x0×(p+q)\nE = 2p + E - x0 (because p+q=1)\n0 = 2p - x0\nx0 = 2p\n\nSo the answer is 2p. Below are the results of computer trials which have verified the answer\nabove.  For each probability p 100,000 trials were conducted, in which a\ntrial ended when either the number of heads equalled the number of tails,\nor the difference was more than 25.  It seems reasonable to assume that for\np<=.4 if the difference ever equals 25 it is very unlikely that the gap\never be closed.

One coin is heads on both sides and the other is heads on one side and tails on the other. One coin is selected from the box at random and the face of one side is observed. If the face is heads what is the probability that the other side is heads? To illustrate why the 1/2 answer is wrong let propose a similar \nproblem.  Suppose a soup company canned 2,000,000 cans of tomato \nsoup.  Suppose further that they put the wrong label on half of the \ncans.  The company then sent 999,999 \ncorrect cans and 1 incorrect can to one store and 999,999 incorrect \ncans and 1 correct can to another store.  To determine which store \nhas the correct cans you go to one store at random and open one \ncan.  You see it does indeed have tomato soup inside.  What is the \nprobability you went to the store with 999,999 correct cans?  It is \nnot reasonable to assume the probability is 50/50 that you are in \neither store.  The odds that you would pick the one correct can in the \nstore with 999,999 incorrect cans are extremely remote.  It is true that \nbefore opening a can the odds were 50/50 but once you do open a can that \ninformation gives you a clue that can not be ignorred.  In fact the \nprobability that you are in the store \nwith the correctly labled cans is 99.9999%. Now let me introduce Bayes' theorem on conditional probability to explain why the \nanswer is 2/3: Let the events A1, ...,Ak for a partition of the space \nS such that Pr(Aj > 0 for j=1,...,k and let B be any event such that \nPr(B) > 0.  Then, for i=1,...,k, Pr(Ai | B) = \n\nPr(Ai) * Pr(B|Ai) / \n\n[ Σ (for j=1 to k) Pr(Aj)*Pr(B|Aj) ] . For the problem in question we can reword this to:\n\nPr(two headed coin|head chosen) = Pr(choosing two headed coin) * Pr(choosing heads given that two headed coin was chosen) / \n[Pr(choosing two headed coin) * Pr(choosing heads given that two headed coin was chosen) + \nPr(choosing one headed coin) * Pr(choosing heads given that one headed coin was chosen)] = 1/2 * 1 / [ (1/2 * 1) + (1/2 * 1/2) ] = 1/2 / (1/2 + 1/4) = (1/2)/(3/4) = (1/2)*(4/3) = 2/3. If this all went over your head think if it another way.  There were 3 heads to begin with.  2 of \nthem have another head on the other side.  You could have chosen any head with equal probability \nand since 2 out of 3 have a head on the reverse side the answer is 2/3.  Of course this answer \nwould probably not merit very much in partial credit in probability class. Some other people have questioned my exact wording of this problem, mainly objecting over \nthe tense of the verb I use for when the coin is chosen.  What appears now was taken \nalmost exactly from a similar problem in Probability and Statistics (second \nedition) by Morris H. Degroot on page 63, problem number 5.  I changed cards to coins and \neliminated what would be the coin with two tails.  The book is a commonly used college \ntext on the subject and should be above reproach.  Here is how they stated a similar problem: Essentially the same problem, but worded using sunken boats, secret compartments, and \nbars of gold, is asked on page 603 of Statistics for Business and Economics by \nEdwin Mansfield. A reader sent in the following explanation that he thought might \nhelp: Here is my favotite e-mail I received on this problem.  I x'd out \nsome private information. I am a biology teacher at Xxxxxxx High School in Xxxxxxx, MA.  I \nrecently was searching for an extra credit question to put on a test \nfor tenth graders.  I used the three coins in a bag problem (#16).  \nUnfortunately, none of my students got the correct answer.  They all \nanswered 1/2.  I have done my best to explain the problem and some of \nthe students now understand why the correct answer is 2/3.  The debate \nhas spread throughout the whole school.  Most teachers and students \nbeleive the answer to be 1/2.  So I started an organization called \nTeam 2/3 - The Probability Masters.  Students take an oath to become \nofficial members of the team.  The mission of the team is to recruit \nas many new members as possible.  Team members get a membership card \nthat has your original question on the back which helps them recruit \nnew team members.  Many people think I have gone off the deep end, but \nI find it amazing that so many people including most teachers and the \nprincipal still do not see the truth.  If fact, the day after I \nstarted the Team 2/3, the principal got on the morning announcements \nand stated the the answer is 1/2 and the group that thinks otherwise \nshould rethink the problem. One student created a computer program that simulates 10,000 coin \npicks in 1 second.  The data clearly show the 2/3 answer.  But that \nsame student insists that the probability is 2/3 only if many trials \nare conducted.  He doesn't understand that the probability is the same \nin the first and last trial.  People are stuck on the idea that you \nmust have either the H-H or H-T coin and say it is 1 out of two.  I \nhave tried to simplify your solution without the T-T coin to help \npeople understand. If two coins:  H-H, H-T Conditional Prob =  1/2 divided by 3/4  =  2/3 Team 2/3 will recruit for two more days and then reveal the truth.  We \nwill try to get the principal to announce that Team 2/3 was correct \nall along.  All team members will hold their heads high if that \nhappens.  I only have one math teacher on my side at this time.  One \nof my student team members had a hat made for me that says \"Team 2/3 \nCaptain\".  I wore it on Friday and will wear it this week.  We  have \nalmost everyone in the school discussing your coin problem.  Many of \nthe students are giving it a great deal of thought. We are very confident that the answer is 2/3, however most people \nstill disagree. It would be most helpful if you would place a call to the school and \ntalk to Mr. Xxxxxxx Xxxxxxxxx, the principal.  This would be greatly \nappreciated by the team, your team, Team 2/3.

With a measuring stick you note how many inches of gas are in the tank. Given this depth of gas, how many cubic inches of gas are in the tank? You may assume the tank is less than half full. Note:  To convert into gallons divide cubic inches by 231 . Next, define x as the shortest distance from the level of gas line segment to the center of the \na circular cross section of the tank.  By the pythagorean formula the length of the level of \ngas line is 2×(r2-x2)1/2. Next measure the area of the triangle with the level of gas segment as a base and the center of \nthe circle as the opposite angle, which is the the sum of two right triangles, or \nx×(r2-x2)1/2. Next, determine the degree of the angle opposite of the base of gas line segment in the triange \nabove.  With a little trigonometry it is found that this angle is 2×cos-1(x/r). Next, find the area of the slice of the circle made between the two equal sides of the triangle \nmentioned above, which is the product of the area of the circule and the ratio of the angle of \nthe wedge to 2×pi:  pi×r2 × (2×cos-1(x/r)/2×pi) = \nr2 × (cos-1(x/r)) . From this wedge subtract the area of the triangle, leaving \nr2 × (cos-1(x/r)) - x×(r2-x2)1/2. Next, multiply by the length of the tank:  l × \n((r2 × (cos-1(x/r)) - x×(r2-x2)1/2).

Next, define x as the shortest distance from the level of gas line segment to the center of the a circular cross \nsection of the tank.  By the pythagorean formula the length of the level of gas line is \n2×(r2-x2)1/2. Next, take the integral from 0 to the depth of the gas, measured in distance from the center of the side.  \nFor example if the level of gas is y (where y is less than x) then the answer is the integral from r-y to r of \n2×(r2-x2)1/2. To solve this integral it is helpful to know that the integral of (r2-x2)1/2 \nis 1/2×[x×(r2-x2)1/2 + r2×sin-1(x/r). I'm sure if you can get this far you can do the rest yourself."}

{"id": "prob_026", "type": "math", "difficulty": "3", "title": "100 single women problem", "content": "The king has 100 young ladies in his court each with an individual dowry. No two dowrys are the same. The king says you may marry the one with the highest dowry if you correctly choose her. The king says that he will parade the ladies one at a time before you and each will tell you her dowry. Only at the time a particular lady is in front of you may you select her. The question is what is the strategy that maximizes your chances to choose the lady with the largest dowry?Hint: You should let x ladies go by and choose the first one with a dowry greater than the maximum of the first x. Of course you will pass the highest one if she is among the first x, but that is part of the game. The probability of winning is sum for i=x+1 to 100 \nof the probability that the highest dowry is in the \nith position multiplied by the probability that you \nchoose it if it is in that position. This is based on the condition probability formula:\nPr(A)=Sum for i=1 to n of Pr( A | Bi ) * Pr( Bi ), \nwhere the sum for i=1 to n of Pr(Bi)=1. For all i the probability that the \nhighest dowry is in that position is 1/100. The probability that you will choose the dowry if \nit is in the ith position is equal to the probability \nthat the highest of the first i-1 dowries belongs \nto one of the first x ladies.  This equals x/(i-1).  If \nthe highest dowry of the first i-1 were not in the first x ladies \nyou would choose it before getting to the largest dowry, \nthus losing the game. For example if you let 30 ladies pass the probability that the \nhighest dowry is in the 75th postion and that you will choose it \n equals 1/100 * 30/74. Let A denote the overall probability of winning.  \nThe proability of winning given x is the sum for i=x+1 to 100 \nof x/(i-1) * 1/n.  This equals: Pr(1/n * [ 1 + x/(x+1) + x/(x+2) + ... + x/99 ] ). Some value of x must be optimal to maximize this formula.  This value \nof x must the first such that Pr(A|x+1) - Pr(A|x) < 0. Pr(A|x+1) - Pr(A|x) = 1/n * [ 1/(x+2) + 1/(x+3) + 1/(x+4) + ... + 1/99 - x/(x+1) ]. let y=x+1. Pr(A|x+1) - Pr(A|x) = 1/n * [ 1/(y+1) + 1/(y+2) + 1/(y+3) + ... + 1/99 - (y-1)/y ]. = Pr(A|x+1) - Pr(A|x) = 1/n * [ 1/(y+1) + 1/(y+2) + 1/(y+3) + ... + 1/99 - 1 + 1/y ]. = Pr(A|x+1) - Pr(A|x) = 1/n * [ 1/y + 1/(y+1) + 1/(y+2) + 1/(y+3) + ... + 1/99 - 1 ]. If Pr(A|x+1) - Pr(A|x) = 0, then 1/y + 1/(y+1) + 1/(y+2) + 1/(y+3) + ... + 1/99 = 1. Theorem:  The integral from r to n of 1/x = log(n) - log(r) = log(n/r). The equation above the theorm is an approximation of the integral in the theorem.  By \napplying the theorem log(100/y) = 1. Taking e to the power of both sides:  100/y = e. y=100/e. Since e=~2.7182818 y=~36.79, since x=y-1 x=~35.79. Since the integral is an underestimate of the series look at some specific \nvalues of Pr(A) for values of x close to 35.79: In general the answer is going to be n/e, where n is the total \nnumber of ladies.  Because the answer must be an \nexact integer and error in applying the theorem mentioned above you should \ncheck the few integers just above the optimal value.  As n increases the \nerror decreases.  The probability of winning turns out to approach 1/e =~ 36.79% \nas n approaches infinity (I'll leave this proof up to you). Here are some optimal values of x for various values of n and \nthe probability of winning given x: Here another version of my solution to this problem Let x be the number of ladies you pass before choosing \nthe next lady with a dowry greater than the first \nx ladies.  Let maxx be the maximum dowry \nin the first x ladies. The probability you will select the highest dowry is: Sum for i=1 to 100-x of: ( Probability that i of the \nremaining ladies will have a dowry greater than maxx ) \n* (1/i). This probability for any i is: Pr(n1) * 1 + \nPr(n2) * 1/2 + \nPr(n3) * 1/3 + \nPr(n4) * 1/4 + \nPr(n5) * 1/5 + \n.\n.\n.\nPr(n70) * 1/70. To derive Pr(ni) consider the probability that the i highest \ndowrys fall in the last 100-x ladies, multiplied the the probability that \nthe (i+1)th highest dowry falls in the first x ladies.  For example: Pr(n3) = 70/100 * 69/99 * 68/98 * 30/97. 70/100 = Probability that the highest dowry is not in first 30.\n69/99 = Probability that the second highest dowry is not in first 30 (99 positions left, 69 \nnot if first 30).\n68/98 = Probability that the third highest dowry is not in first 30.\n30/97 = Probability that fourth highest dowry is in first 30. Personally I had to use a spreadsheet to find that the maximum \nprobability was for x=37, which was 37.1%. If you change the number of total ladies from 100 to any other number the strategy \nseems to still be to let 37% of them go by first."}

{"id": "prob_029", "type": "math", "difficulty": "3", "title": "Four dogs and a square problem", "content": "Four dogs occupy the four corners of a square with side of length a. At the same time each dog starts walking at the same speed directly toward the dog on his left. Eventually all four dogs will converge at the center of the square. What path does each dog follow and what is the distance each dog walks until he reaches the center? The total distance covered is a. Let C be the center of the square at point (0,0).  Let the dogs be at initial points (.5,.5), (.5,-.5), (-.5,-.5), and (-.5,.5).  Let dog 1 bet at (.5,-.5) who is chasing dog 2 at (.5,.5).  Consider the line from C to dog 1.  Next consider the line from dog 1 to dog 2.  The angle between these lines is 135 degrees. Theorem:  Let C be a fixed point, D a point on a curve, r the distance from C to D, x the polar angle formed by r, and y the angle formed by the angle between CD and the tangent line to the curve at point D.  Then tan(y)=r/(dr/dx). So the line of sight from the center to the initial point of dog 1 would be be at a 270 degree angle.  The line of sight from dog 1 to dog 2 would be a vertical line of 90 degrees.  The angle between these lines is 270 degrees.  The tangent of 270 is -1.  So we have r/(dr/dx) = -1.  Thus r(x)=c*e-x. At the moment the dogs start walking x equals 0.  At this moment the distance from the center to any of the dogs is 2-1/2.  So r(x)=2-1/2*e-x. The arc length is given by the formula:  \nIntegral from 0 to infinity of ((f(x))2+(f'(x))2)1/2 = \n\nIntegral from 0 to infinity of ((2-1/2*e-x)2 + (-2-1/2*e-x)2)1/2 = \n\nIntegral from 0 to infinity of (2-1*e-2x + 2-1*e-2x)1/2 = \n\nIntegral from 0 to infinity of e-x = \n\n-e-x from 0 to infinity = \n\n=0 - (-e0) = \n\n0 -(-1) = 1\n\nThe path the dogs take is called a logarithmic spiral.  It is an interesting paradox that the dogs will make an infinite number of circles, yet the total distance is constant.  Every revolution the size of the square will to e-2*pi/21/2 = 0.03055663 times it's size before the revolution. Suppose dog A is pursuing dog B who is pursuing dog C.  During the entire pursuit,\nthe dogs remain at the corners of a square, and angle ABC is a constant 90 degrees.\nThat is, B's path towards C is always perpendicular to A's path towards B, and B\nhas zero velocity in the direction along A's path.  Since B neither approaches nor\nrecedes from A during the walk, A simply covers the intial separation of 1. Antonio Molins went further to state that as dog A is heading direcctly towards dog B, dog B is moving towards from dog A at rate equal to cosine of any of the interior angles of the shape made by the dogs.  He also provided the following graphics. For example consider a pentagon.  Remember that for a n-gon of n sides each angle will be 180*(1-(2/n)).  So a pentagon will have angles of 108°.      Let's assume each dog walks at a rate of 1 unit per minute, where the initial shape has sides of 1 unit.  As pointed out by David Wilson we can forget about the spiral paths but instead think of the dogs walking in straight lines.  In the case of the penagon for every one unit dog A draw towards dog B's initial position, dog B will draw cos(180°)=-0.309 units towards dog A.  The question is, how long will it take for them to meet?  Let the answer to that question be t.  In t seconds dog A will cover t units, and dog B will cover .309*t units.  The total distance traveled by A equals the distance traveled by B plus 1 (the initial separation).  So solving for t: t=0.309+1 --> t=1/(1-.309) --> t=1.4472. Thus the general formula is 1/(1+cos(t)), where t is an interior angle of the shape.

A second boat is 50 kilometers directly north of the first boat at time t=0. The second boat can travel at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour. The direction of the second boat at all times is such that the first boat is directly in front of it. You may assume the earth is flat for the purposes of this problem.What path does the second boat take and at what time will it intercept the first boat?In the graph above the speed of the fast boat (green) is 2 kph, and the speed of the slow boat (blue) 1 kph. I changed the parameters because I didn't want to give away the answer in the graph. x = 75 * [ 1/5*(y/50)5/3 - (y/50)1/3 ] + 60 It takes 3 hours for the chasing boat to catch the other boat. Place the slower boat initially at the origin of a coordinate \nplane, and equate \"north\" with the positive y-axis, and east with \nthe positive x-axis.  The faster boat starts at the point (50,0).  \nThe \"curve\" shall refer to the path of the faster boat.  t shall \nrefer to time since both boats left their starting positions. There are two ways to indicate the slope at any point along \nthe curve.  One is dy/dx.  The other is (x-20t)/y, since the \nfaster boat is always pointing towards the slower boat.  Thus \ndy/dx=y/(x-20t). The above equation can also be derived this way (optional): y = y'(x1)*x - 20*t1*y'(x1) Rearranging that, and phrasing it as a general statement rather than a\n\nparticular point (the point x1 was arbitrary, so this applies to every point\n\non the curve). dy/dx * (x-20t) = y\n  dy/dx = y/(x-20t) Something interesting can be found if you treat x as a function of y, \ninstead of the other way around: dx/dy = (x-20t)/y This is justifiable, though it may look like abuse of Leibniz, the \nderivative of the inverse of a function is the reciprocal of the derivative \nof the function. Then multiply both sides by y: y * dx/dy = x - 20t And here's the killer... differentiate with respect to y, using the product \nrule on the left hand side: (1 * dx/dy) + (y * d2x/dy2 ) = \ndx/dy - (20 * dt/dy) There's a dx/dy term on each side of the equation, and they now happily \ndisappear. [1]  y * d2x/dy2 = -20 * dt/dy Now it's time to turn dt/dy into something we can work with. I split \nit up as follows: dt/dy = (dt/ds) * (ds/dy) Where s is the arc length, the distance traveled so far by the chasing \nboat. dt/ds is known (it's the reciprocal of the chasing boat's speed ds/dt=30kph), \nand ds/dy can be expressed in terms of dx and dy by applying the arc length \nformula: The formula for arc length is: s=Integral of [ (1+(dx/dy)2)1/2 ] dy Take the derivative of both sides: ds/dy=(1+(dx/dy)2)1/2, remember that \nthe square root can be positive or negative. Here is another way to derive this: sqrt both sides... |ds/dy| = sqrt((dx/dy)2 + 1)\n\n  ds/dy = +/-sqrt((dx/dy)2 + 1) We need to choose a sign here. Look which way the curve goes. As t increases, \ny decreases. At the same time, s (the distance traveled by the chasing boat) \nincreases. Therefore, ds/dy must be negative. ds/dy = -sqrt((dx/dy)2 + 1) Substituting all this back into the equation marked [1], you get: y * d2x/dy2 = -20 * (1/30) * -sqrt((dx/dy)2 + 1)\n  y * d2x/dy2 = 2/3 * sqrt((dx/dy)2 + 1) That's a second-order differential equation, but not one of the extremely \ndifficult kind. Rewrite it with a new variable u=dx/dy, and it becomes a \nfirst-order diffeq: y * du/dy = 2/3 * sqrt(u2+1) Breathe a sigh of relief, because that's separable. (I spent most of my \nsolution time needlessly hacking away at this with more advanced diffeq \ntechniques before I noticed it was separable. D'oh!) ln(u + sqrt(u2+1)) = 2/3 * ln y + K I've dispensed with the absolute value stuff, since u+sqrt(u2+1) can't be \nnegative, and y isn't negative either, for the part of the curve that's \nrelevant to the original question. exp() both sides... u + sqrt(u2+1) = C*y2/3\n\nK was an integration constant; C is exp(K). To find C, use the point (0,50) on the curve. This is at t=0, when the \ntarget boat is due south of the chasing boat. The curve's tangent at that \npoint is vertical, so u=dx/dy=0. Plug in u=0 and y=50: 0+1 = C*502/3\n  C = 1/502/3 Put that back in... u + sqrt(u2+1) = (y/50)2/3 We've still got some differential equations work to do.. u is a \nderivative! argh, a derivative in a radical. But it works itself out, \njust rationalize it: sqrt(u2+1) = (y/50)2/3 - u\n  u2+1 = (y/50)4/3 - 2u(y/50)2/3 + u2 Lucked out again. Cancel u2's... 1 = (y/50)4/3 - 2u(y/50)2/3\n  2u(y/50)2/3 = (y/50)4/3 - 1\n  2u = (y/50)2/3 - (y/50)-2/3\n  u = 1/2*[ (y/50)2/3 - (y/50)-2/3 ]\n  dx/dy = 1/2*[ (y/50)2/3 - (y/50)-2/3 ] A simple integration: x = 1/2 * [ 3/5*(y/50)5/3*50 - 3*(y/50)1/3*50 ] + K Factor out those 3's and 50's x = 75 * [ 1/5*(y/50)5/3 - (y/50)1/3 ] + K Again look at the starting point. When x is 0, y is 50. 0 = 75 * [ 1/5*15/3 - 11/3 ] + K\n  0 = 75 * [ 1/5 - 1 ] + K\n  0 = -60 + K\n  60 = K x = 75 * [ 1/5*(y/50)5/3 - (y/50)1/3 ] + 60 That's the path the chasing boat follows. If that curve has a name, I don't\nknow what it is. The chasing boat intercepts the other boat when y=0. x = 75 * [ 1/5*0 - 0 ] + 60\n  x = 60 The boats meet at the point (60,0). Since the slower boat is traveling due\neast at 20kph, it must have taken 3 hours to get there. It takes 3 hours for the chasing boat to catch the other boat. Below is another solution provided by Tristan Simbulan: let t = s/30, distance traveled by first boat is 20 * s/30 = 2/3 * s  dy/dx=y/( x - 2/3 * s), at t = 0 dy/dx is 50/0 is undefinable. At t=0 dx/dy=0/50=0 is definable. dx/dy = (x-2/3*s)/y,      y * dx/dy = x - 2/3 * s,  take second derivative. Let first derivative dx/dy = p and second derivative dp/dy,   ds/dy = sqrt(1 + (dx/dy)^2) = sqrt( 1+ p^2 )    dy/y = -3/2 * dp/sqrt(1+ p^2),     lny + C = -3/2 * ln( p + sqrt( 1 + p^2 )),     substitute initial condition y = 50, p = 0. C = -ln 50.      p = dx/dy = 0  y = { p + sqrt(1 + p^2 ) }^(-3/2) * 50 = { dx/dy + sqrt( 1 + (dx/dy)^2) }^(-3/2) * 50 Integration result:  2 * 50^(2/3)x =50^(4/3) * y^(1/3) * 3 - { y^(5/3) * 3/5 } + C  C = 12/5 * 50^(5/3) at initial x = 0     y = 50 substitute value of C and you get equation of the curve. At y = 0,  x = 60 .       divide distance by rate = time = 60/20 = 3 hours Note:  For the general case in which the slow boat \ntravels at a k.p.h, the fast boat travels at b k.p.h., and the \ninitial distance is d kilometers the formula of the curve is: x = 1/2*[ db/(a+b)*(y/d)(a+b)/b - db/(b-a)*(y/d)(b-a)/b \n+ db/(b-a) - db/(a+b) ] The time to interception is [db/(b-a) - db/(a+b)]/2a."}

The only one of these composed of 0's and 1's is obviously 00, so the answer must end in 00.  The hard part is finding a series of 0's and 1's preceeding the 00 that will make the entire number divisible by 9. If you didn't already know the following trick then this problem would be very hard.  If you did know it then the problem was was likely very easy.  The trick is that if the sum of digits of a number is divisible by 9 then the number itself is also divisible by 9.  Note that this is true for 3 also.  For example the number 17685 is divisible by 9 because 1+7+6+8+5=27, and 27 is divisible by 9. To prove this let's consider any five digit number, abcde.  This number can be expressed as follows. a*10000 + b*1000 + c*100 + d*10 + e = a*(9999+1) + b*(999+1) + c*(99+1) + d*(9+1) + e*1 = a*9999 + b*999 + c*99 + d*9 + a + b + c + d + e = 9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) + a + b + c + d + e Thus 9*(a*1111 + b*111 + c*11 + d*1) is a multiple of 9.  So if a+b+c+d+e is also a multiple of 9 then the entire number must be a multiple of 9.  Note also that the remainder of abcde/9 is the same as the remainder of (a+b+c+d+e)/9. The smallest number consisting of all 1's and divisible by 9 is thus 111,111,111.  Adding the two zeros at the end results in the answer to the problem: 11,111,111,100."}

Now consider the added two chords in the next diagram: The isosceles triangle formed by these two chords and one side of the pentagon is \ncongruent to the triangle formed by two extensions of length a and the same side \nof the pentagon.

We can use \nthe Pythagorean formula, with this chord as the hypotenuse to obtain: x2 + (1/2)2 = a2. Substituting for x2 from above we can solve for a: a + 3/4 = a2 - (1/2)2, or a2 - a - 1 = 0, or a=(1+sqr(5))/2.

Call any corner of the dodecahedron a.  Call the three corners surrounding a to be b, c, and d.  Call q the point at the center of triangle bcd.  Call p the point at the center of the dodecahedron. From problem 123 we know the distance from two non-adjacent corners in a pentagon to be (1+sqr(5))/2.  Knowing this and that cos(30)=sqr(3)/2 we can determine that BQ=(sqr(3)+sqr(15))/6.

Even the first integration of this is very messy, requiring a big table \nof integrals, and I think at best a small book of integrals would only \ntake you through the second one.  So we need to be more creative to \nmake the problem more managable.  First we introduce a change of \nvariables: Or: (1):  Now we have I(0,1) I(t,t-1) I(0,1) I(s,s-1) sqr(u2 + v2) * |J| du ds dv dt Where |J| = the Jacobian = Now lets solve the following inner two integrals of equation (1): (2):  I(0,1) I(s,s-1) sqr(u2 + v2) du ds. The area of integration is bounded by the quadrilateral \nwith vertices (0,0), (1,1), (0,1), and (-1,0), with s being \nthe horizontal axis and u being the vertical. Changing the order of integral we get: I(-1,0) I(0,u+1) sqr(u2 + v2) ds du + \nI(0,1) I(u,1) sqr(u2 + v2) ds du = I(1,0) sqr(u2 + v2) * (1+u) du + \nI(0,1) sqr(u2 + v2) * (1-u) du = -I(1,0) sqr(p2 + v2) * (1-p) dp + \nI(0,1) sqr(u2 + v2) * (1-u) du \n(letting p=-u in the first integral) = I(0,1) sqr(p2 + v2) * (1-p) dp + \nI(0,1) sqr(u2 + v2) * (1-u) du (Notice the two terms are equal)= 2* I(0,1) sqr(u2 + v2) * (1-u) du. Now put this into equation (1), and moving the constant terms to the left: -2* I(0,1) I(t,t-1) I(0,1) sqr(u2 + v2) * (1-u) du dv dt  = -2* I(0,1) I(0,1) I(t,t-1) sqr(u2 + v2) * (1-u) dv dt du (changing the order of integration)= -2* I(0,1) (1-u) I(0,1) I(t,t-1) sqr(u2 + v2) dv dt du = Note that the inner two integral are of the same form as equation (2), thus: 4* I(0,1) I(0,1) sqr(u2 + v2) * (1-u) * (1-v)  dv du = 4* I(0,1) I(0,1) sqr(u2 + v2) * (1-u) * (1-v)  du dv (changing the order of integration) Next we make another substitution: This time the Jacobian shall equal: Thus the integral as a function of w and r is: -8 * I(0,pi/4) I(0,1/cos(w)) -r * sqr(r*sin2(w) + r*cos2(w)) * (1-r*cos(w)) * (1-r*sin(w)) dr dw. Note that we halved the area of integration, going from 0 to pi/4 as opposed to pi/2, and \nmultiplying by 8 instead of the 4.  This is permissible because of the symetry of \nthe two regions. = 8 * I(0,pi/4) I(0,1/cos(w)) r2 * (1-r*cos(w)) * (1-r*sin(w)) dr dw. = 8 * I(0,pi/4) I(0,1/cos(w)) r2 - r3*(cos(w)+sin(w)) + \nr4*(cos(w)+sin(w)) dr dw. = 8 * I(0,pi/4) r3/3 - r4*(cos(w)+sin(w))/4 + \nr5*(cos(w)+sin(w))/5 ( from 0 to 1/cos(w) ) dw. = 8 * I(0,pi/4) (3*cos3(w))-1 - (cos(w)+sin(w))/(4*cos4)\n+ (cos(w)+sin(w))/(5*cos5(w)) dw. = 8 * I(0,pi/4) (3*cos3(w))-1 - \n(4*cos3(w))-1 - \nsin(w)*(4*cos4(w))-1 + \nsin(w)*(5*cos4(w))-1 dw. = 8 * I(0,pi/4) (12*cos3(w))-1 - \nsin(w)*(20*cos4(w))-1  dw. (3) = 2/15 * I(0,pi/4) 5/cos3(w) - \n3*sin(w)/cos4(w) dw. Next we must dust off our table of integrals to help us with the integral of cos-3(w). I dx/cosn(x) = (1/(n-1)) * sin(x)/cosn-1(x) + ((n-2)/(n-1)) * I dx/cosn-2(x). In our case n=3 so, I dx/cos3(x) = (1/2) * sin(x)/cos2(x) + (1/2) * I sec(x) dx. Now lets look up the integral of sec(x): I sec(x) dx = (1/2) * ln((1+sin(x))/(1-sin(x))). Now we are ready to integrate cos-3(w): I(0,pi/4) cos-3(w) dw = sin(w)/(2*cos2(w)) (from 0 to pi/4) + (1/2)*I(0,pi/4) sec(x) dx. = (1/2)*(2-1/2/2-1 - 0) + (1/4)*ln((2+sqr(2))/(2-sqr(2))). = (1/2)*sqr(2) + (1/4)*ln(((2+sqr(2))/2+sqr(2))/((2-sqr(2))*(2+sqr(2))). = 1/sqr(2) + (1/4)*ln((4+4*sqr(2)+2)/(4-2)). = 1/sqr(2) + (1/4)*ln(3+2*sqr(2)). = 1/sqr(2) + (1/2)*ln(3+2*sqr(2))1/2. = 1/sqr(2) + (1/2)*ln(1+sqr(2)). Now lets integrate sin(w)/cos4(w). let m=cos(w), thus dm=-sin(w) dw. I(0,pi/4) sin(w)/cos4(w). = I(1,1/sqr(2)) -1*m-4 dm. = 1/(3*m3) from 0 to 1/sqr(2). = (1/3) * (2*sqr(2) - 1). Not it is time to plus these integrals into equation (3): (2/15) * [ 5*(1/sqr(2) + (1/2)*ln(1+sqr(2))) + 3*((1/3) * (2*sqr(2) - 1)) ] = (2/15) * [ 5*sqr(2)/2 + (5/2)*ln(1+sqr(2)) - 4*sqr(2)/2 + 1 ] = (2/15) * [ sqr(2)/2 + (5/2)*ln(1+sqr(2)) + 1 ] = (sqr(2) + 2 + 5*ln(1+sqr(2))) / 15."}

Without considering the wind the bird can fly at a speed of 5 feet per second. There is a north blowing wind, however, at a speed of 2 feet per second. At all times the bird is flying in a direction such that he is directly facing the nest. The bird is not tacking into the wind as a boat would do but is continuously being blown off course and trying to set a new course. The graph above shows the path of the bird. How long does it take for the bird to reach the nest? First reword the problem such that the coordinates of the bird's initial position are (100,0) \nand the nest is at (0,0).  In polar coordinates the inital position of the bird \nis (100,0o).  Let p stand for the distance to the origin in polar coordinates, \nand let a stand for the angle. Considering that the bird always flied towards the nest (p direction) and the wind blows \nnorth (y direction) the following graph shows the change in the variables with respect to \na change of one infinitesimal unit of time in units of time.  Note that as an angle \napproaches zero its arc approaches a straight line. (1) dp/dt = -5 + 2sin(a).\n(2) da/dt = 2cos(a)/p. (3) dx/dt = -5cos(a).\n(4) dy/dt = 2 - 5sin(a). Divide eq. (3) by eq. (2): (5) dx/da = (dx/dt)/(da/dt) = -5pcos(a)/2cos(a) = -5p/2 = -(5/2)*(x/cos(a)). (see graph above) Rearrange: (6) (2/x)dx = (-5/cos(a))da. Integrate both sides: (7) ln(x2) = -ln(sec(a)+tan(a))5 + C you might need an \nintegral table for the integral of 1/cos(a). Exp() both sides: (8) x2*(sec(a) + tan(a))5 = C. Put in the intial condition of x=100, a=0 to solve for the constant: (9) x2*(sec(a) + tan(a)) = 10,000. (sec(a) + tan(a))5 = (100/x)2. (sec(a) + tan(a)) = (100/x)2/5. Let b=(100/x)2/5, then: (10)  sec(a) + tan(a) = b. (11) (1+sin(a))/cos(a) = b (sec(a)=1/cos(a), tan(a)=sin(a)/cos(a)). (12) (1+(1-cos2(a))1/2) / cos(a) = b. 1+(1-cos2(a))1/2 = b*cos(a). (1-cos2(a))1/2 = b*cos(a) - 1. 1-cos2(a) = b2*cos2(a) - 2*b*cos(a) + 1. 2*b*cos(a) = (1+b2)*cos2(a). 2*b = (1+b2)*cos(a). (13) cos(a) = 2*b / (1+b2). Substitute equation (13) into equation (3): (14) dx/dt = -5*cos(a) = -10*b / (1+b2). Rearranging: dt = -(1+b2)/(10*b) dx. -10 dt = b+(1/b) dx (15) -10 dt = (100/x)2/5 dx + (x/100)2/5 dx,  remember b=(100/x)2/5 Integrating: (16) Constant -10t = (5/3)*1002/5*x3/5 + (5/7)*(1/100)2/5*x7/5. Put in the initial constants t=0 and x=100: Const =  (5/3)*1002/5*1003/5 + (5/7)*(1/100)2/5*1007/5. Const = (5/3)*100 + (5/7)*100 = 5000/21. So the function of x and t is: (17) 5000/21 - 10t = (5/3)*1002/5*x3/5 + (5/7)*(1/100)2/5*x7/5. The original question was how long does it take the bird to reach the nest, in other words what is \nt when x=0.  By substituting x=0 in the above equation t = Const/10 = 500/21. Tristan Simbulan sent in the following solution which you may find better: The initial position of the bird is ( 100, 0 ) and the nest is ( 0, 0 ) I am using the \nvelocity vector component parallel to y and x. Let a be the angle between x axis and \nbird's line of sight towards ( 0, 0 ). (1)The wind velocity minus y component of the \nbird's velocity = dy/dt = 2 - 5 sin a = 2 - 5 * y/sqrt(x^2 + y^2) (2) Velocity x \ncomponent = dx/dt = - 5 cos a = - 5 * x / sqrt( x^2 + y^2 ) (3) (dy/dt)/(dx/dt) = \ndy/dx = [ 5y -2 * sqrt(x^2 + y^2) ] / 5x  5xdy - 5ydx + 2 * sqrt(x^2 + y^2) dx = \n0 Let y = vx, dy = vdx + x dv , the result by substitution is dv/sqrt(1 + v^2) + \n2/5 * dx/x = 0. ln[ v + sqrt(1 + v^2) ] + 2/5 ln x = C since v = y/x, by substitution \nln [ y/x + sqrt(1 + y^2/x^2) ] + 2/5*ln x = C At y = 0 and x = 100 , then C = \nln 100^(2/5). The equation of the curve is sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = x^(3/5) *100^(2/5) - \ny. Square both sides then y = [ 100^(4/5) * x^(3/5) - x^(7/5) ] / [ 2 * 100^(2/5)]. Solve (2) Velocity x component = dx/dt = - 5 cos a = - 5 * x / sqrt( x^2 + y^2 ) \nin terms of y. By algebraic manipulation using fractional exponent and factoring \nthe result is 100^(4/5) * x^(-2/5) dx + x^2/5 dx = - 10^(9/5) dt 5/3 *100^(4/5) * \nx^(3/5) + 5/7 * x^(7/5) = - 10^(9/5) * t + C At x =100 and t = 0 , C = 100^(7/5) * \n50/21. At x = 0 the result is 0 = - 10^(9/5) * t + C , substitute C = 100^(7/5) * \n50/21 Solve: 10^(9/5)*t = 100^(7/5) * 50/21. Therefore t = [100^(7/5)] / [10^(9/5)] \n* 50/21 t = [ 10^(14/5) ] / 10^(9/5) * 50/21 = 10 *50/21 = 500/21. Go back to Problem 55\nGo back to Shack's Math Problems"}

No discards, just the first five cards. Remember, aces can be high or low. If you had x cards and chose y of them, the number of \nunique sets you could create would be x!/(y!*(x-y)!).  For the \npurposes of this document I shall notate this is (x:y). The number of ways to arrange 5 cards out of 52 is (52:5) = 2,598,960.  \nThe odds of drawing any given hand are the number of ways it can \nbe arranged divided by the total number of ways to arrange five cards above.\nBelow are the number of ways to arrange each hand. Royal Flush The number of different royal flushes are four (one for each suit). Straight Flush The highest card in a straight flush can be 5,6,7,8,9,10,Jack,Queen, or King.  \nThus there are 9 possible high cards, and 4 possible suits, creating 9 * 4 = 36 different \npossible straight flushes. Four of a Kind There are 13 different possible ranks of the 4 of a kind.  The fifth card could \nbe anything of the remaining 48.  Thus there are 13 * 48 = 624 different four of \na kinds. Full House There are 13 different possible ranks for the three of a kind, and 12 left for the two \nof a kind.  There are 4 ways to arrange three cards of one rank (4 different cards to \nleave out), and (4:2) = 6 ways to arrange two cards of one rank.  Thus there are \n13 * 12 * 4 * 6 =  3,744 ways to create a full house. Flush There are 4 suits to choose from and (13:5) = 1,287 ways to arrange five cards in the same \nsuit.  Then subtract the royal and straight flushes to avoid double counting.  The \ntotal number of flushes is 4 * 1,287 - 4 - 36 = 5,108. Straight The highest card in a straight flush can be 5,6,7,8,9,10,Jack,Queen,King, or Ace.  \nThus there are 10 possible high cards.  Each card may be of four different suits.  \nThen subtract the royal and straight flushes to avoid double counting.  Thus the \nnumber of ways to arrange a straight is 10 * 45 - 4 - 36 = 10,200. Three of a Kind There are 13 ranks to choose from for the three of a kind and 4 ways to arrange \n3 cards among the four to choose from.  There are (12:2) = 66 ways to arrange the other \ntwo ranks to choose from for the other two cards.  In each of the two ranks there are four \ncards to choose from.  Thus the number of ways to arrange a three of a kind \nis 13 * 4 * 66 * 42 = 54,912. Two Pair There are combin(13,2)=78 ways to choose 2 ranks out of 13 for the two pair.  Then there are 11 ranks left for the singleton.  For each pair there are combin(4,2)=6 ways to choose 2 suits out of 4.  For the singleton there are 4 possible suits to chose from.  So the total two pair combinations are 78*11*6*6*4 = 123,552. There are 13 ranks to choose from for the pair and (4:2) = 6 ways to arrange the two \ncards in the pair.  There are (12:3) = 220 ways to arrange the other three ranks \nof the singletons, and four cards to choose from in each rank.  Thus there are \n13 * 6 * 220 * 43 = 1,098,240 ways to arrange a pair. Nothing There must be five different ranks represented, of which there are (13:5) = 1,287 \npossible combinations.  Each rank has four cards to choose from.  Finally subtract \nthe number of straights, flushes, straight flushes, and royal flushes, to \navoid double counting.

What is the shortest distance along the surface from point A to point B.  Let p1 and p2 be the two longitudes, measured from 0 to 2*pi.  Let q1 and q2 be the two latitudes, measured from 0 to pi, where 0=north pole and pi=south pole. Next order the two points such that p1 <= p2. Next put the two points in cartesial coordinates (x,y,z). Through a little geometry it can be found that:\n(x1,y1,z1) = \n(cos(p1)*sin(q1), sin(p1)*sin(q1), cos(q1)) and \n(x2,y2,z2) = \n(cos(p2)*sin(q2), sin(p2)*sin(q2), cos(q2)). The angle between two vectors is defined as cos(t)=(v dot w)/(|v| * |w|). Let v donate the vector from (0,0,0) to (x1,y1,z1) and \nlet w donate the vector from (0,0,0) to (x2,y2,z2). The dot product of v and w is:\n\ncos(p1)*sin(q1)*cos(p2)*sin(q2) + \nsin(p1)*sin(q1)*sin(p2)*sin(q2) + \ncos(q1)*cos(q2). If we rotate the longitude of both points by p1 then p1 becomes 0 and \np2 becomes p2-p1, in which case the dot product is:\ncos(0)*sin(q1)*cos(p2-p1)*sin(q2) + \nsin(0)*sin(q1)*sin(p2-p1)*sin(q2) + \ncos(q1)*cos(q2). = \nsin(q1)*cos(p2-p1)*sin(q2) + \ncos(q1)*cos(q2). Now, both |u| and |v| must be 1 since they lie on the surface of a unit sphere.  Thus the \nangle between the two points must be cos-1[sin(q1)*cos(p2-p1)*sin(q2) + \ncos(q1)*cos(q2) / (1 * 1). = sin(q1)*cos(p2-p1)*sin(q2) + \ncos(q1)*cos(q2)]. This angle is the ratio of the distance along the surface between the \ntwo points to the circumference of the earth.  Thus the distance is the angle times \nthe circumference of the earth which equals:\n\ncos-1[(sin(q1)*cos(p2-p1)*sin(q2) + \ncos(q1)*cos(q2))] * r."}

Nick Hobson sent in the following proof that 1, 3, 9, 27 is a unique \nsolution: Hi Mike, Here is my proof of the uniqueness of the solution to the weights puzzle.  The \nanswer \"drops out\" of the proof, though I must admit I first guessed the answer, \nand then came up with this proof! First of all, think of each of the counterweights {a,b,c,d} as having a \ncoefficient which can be one of {-1,0,+1}.  Three coefficients varying over four\nweights give 3 to the power 4 = 81 possible combinations. When the coefficients are all 0, the result is clearly 0.  Otherwise, if a given\nset of coefficients gives +n, you can flip all the signs to get -n.  Therefore, \nif there is a solution to the problem, all 81 integer weights from -40 to +40 \nmust be generated. We now prove the weights must sum to 40 and must all be integers.  Clearly, the \nsum must be >= 40, or 40 itself could not be generated.  If the sum was > 40 you \ncould generate a result outside the solution set, and hence must miss a number \nwithin the set.  Similarly for a non-integer weight. Now, add one to each of the coefficients, giving {0,1,2}.  The equivalent \nproblem is now: what weights can generate all integers from 0 thru 80? Thinking in base 3, the powers of 3 {1,3,9,27} stand out as one obvious \nsolution. Finally, we can prove uniqueness.  Note that we now have no negative \ncoefficients.  Therefore, to generate 1, we need a weight of 1.  Using this we \ncan generate 2.  But for 3, we need a weight of 3.  Now we can generate up to 8 \n(22 in base 3); so next we need a weight of 9.  Then 27.  Hence the solution is \nunique.  Clearly this can be generalized to n weights. Regards,\nNick"}

According to pirate rules the pirate of highest rank must make a suggestion on how to divide the money. If a majority agree to his suggestion then it is to be followed by all the pirates. However, if the suggestion does not get a majority approval then the suggesting pirate is thrown overboard, after which time the remaining pirate of highest rank then makes a suggestion under the same rules. This process repeats, if necessary, until only the pirate of lowest rank is left, in which case he would get everything. Any pirate may suggest any distribution, rank does not guarantee getting more coins than anybody else. Assume that all pirates are infinitely greedy, infinitely logical, and infintely bloodthirsty, and that each pirate knows this to be true of every other pirate. The highest priority of each pirate is to get as much money for themselves as possible. The second highest priority is to throw overboard the other pirates. A pirate will vote to throw another one over even if they have no monetary gain by doing so, and even if it would cost them their own life, but would not if throwing them over would cost even 1 coin. How should the first pirate suggest dividing the money? If only pirate 5 were left he would get everything. If only pirate 4 and 5 were left then pirate 4 has no hope, regardless of what he suggests pirate 5 will vote to throw him overboard, and overboard he will go.  Thus it doesn't make any difference what pirate 4 suggests. If only pirates 3,4, and 5 were left then pirate 3 could count on pirate 4's support as long as \npirate 4 got at least 1 coin.  This is because if pirate 3 goes overboard pirate 4 knows he will get nothing.  So pirate 3 would suggest (0,1,999) to which he and pirate 4 would vote 'yes.'  Note that according to the problem pirate 4 would vote 'no' to (0,0,1000), even though a 'yes' vote would save his own life his pleasure of throwing pirate 3 over would be worth his \nown life. If only pirates 2,3,4, and 5 were left then pirate 2 could count on pirate 3 voting 'no' unless pirate 3 got more than 999 coins, which would leave everybody else with 0, which obviously wouldn't pass.  So pirate 2 should not count on pirate 3's support so he shouldn't waste any \ncoins on him.  If pirate 2 goes overboard he knows the money will be distributed (0,1,999).  So if he offers 2 coins to pirate 4 and 1 coin to pirate 5 then he will get their support since they will come out better voting 'yes.'  Thus pirate 2's suggestion would be (1,2,0,997) to which pirates 2, 4 and 5 would vote 'yes.' Thus if all five pirates were left pirate 1 could count on pirate 2 voting 'no' since pirate 2 would get 997 if pirate 1 went overboard.  So pirate 1 should not waste any coins on pirate 2 since he will vote 'no' anyway and concentrate on winning 2 votes from the other 3.  If pirate 1 goes overboard the money will be distributed (1,2,0,997).  So it would cost 2 coins to get \npirate 5's support, 3 coins to get priate 4's support, and 1 coin to get pirate 3's support.  Since he only needs to buy two votes the cheapest two are pirates 5 and 3.  Thus pirate 1 would \nsuggest (2,0,1,0,997) to which pirate 1, 3, and 5 would vote 'yes'.

Solution 1 The house advantage in just the pass line bet is 7/495, see the \nsolution to problem 82 for an explanation of \nthis step. There is a 1/3 chance that the come out roll will be a 2,3,7,11, or 12, click \nhere if this step needs explanation. There is a 2/3 chance that double odds will be taken.  Given that $1 is bet \non the pass line the expected money bet per round is 1/3*$1 + 2/3*$3 = $7/3.  \nSince $1 is always bet on the pass line 1/(7/3)=3/7 of money bet, overall, is on the pass \nline, and the other 4/7 is on the odds. Thus the house advantage is 3/7*(7/495) + 4/7*0 = 3/495 = 1/165.  The players \nadvantage is just the opposite of this, -1/165. Solution 2 The player's advantage is the sum over all possible outcomes of the product of \nthe probability of the outcome and the net profit or loss, divided by the sum over \nall possible outcomes of the expected amount bet. Lets say the original wager on the pass line is 5.  By summing the following \npossible outcomes you will have the expected gain or loss. Now lets sum the expected amount wagered: If the first roll is a 2,3,7,11, or 12 the wager is 5.  \nIf the first roll is anything else the wager is 15.\n\nThus the expected wager is (1+2+6+2+1)/36 * 5 + (3+4+5+5+4+3)/36 * 15 = 60/36 + 360/36 = 420/36 = 35/3. Thus the player's advantage is (-2520/35640) / (35/3) = -7560/1,247,400 = -378/62370 = -1/165. In other words the house has an advantage of approximately 0.61%."}

The length of the dog's chain is pi. The dog may not go inside the lighthouse. How much area can the dog cover? Since the radius of the lighthouse is 1 the length of the straight part of the \nchain is the same as x.  Through a little trigonomtry we can get the coordinates \nof the dog given x as (cos(x)+x*sin(x),sin(x)-x*cos(x)).  The distance from \n(0,0) to the dog, given x, conveniently works out to (1+x2)1/2, \nusing the length of a line segment formula. Lets call y the angle fromed by (1,0), (0,0), and the location of the dog.  \nThrough some more trigonomty (again left up to you) we can solve for y  \nin terms of x as y=x-tan-1.  Now we are ready to integrate. The area in terms of polar coordinates is 1/2 * the integral over the range \nof the angle of the radius squared.  We can not simply take the integral from \n0 to Π of 1+x2 because this is not the radius formed by the angle \nx, but the radius formed by y.  We could take the integral over the range of \nthe angle y but finding the coordinates of the dog in terms of y is very hard \n(I couldn't do it).  However we can take the ingregal as x goes from 0 to \nΠ of 1+x2 multiplied by the change in y given a change a change \nin x.  Since y=x-tan-1(x). dy/dx = 1-1/(1+x2)! So now the area becomes the integral as x goes from 0 to Π of 1/2 the product \nof 1+x2 and 1-1/(1+x2) which equals 1/2 the integral from \n0 to Π of x2 which equals Π3/6. This integral, however, does not cover the area bounded by the triangle (0,0), (-1,0) and \n(-1,Π).  So we must add this area which is Π/2.  Yet we must subtract the area \ninside the lighthouse which the dog may not go in, which is also Π/2.  So these \ntwo modifications conventiently cancel each other out. The area of the quarter circle to the left of x=-1 and above y=0 is Π3/4, \nsince the length of the chain is Π and the dog covers a semicircle to the left of the \nlighthouse.  So the total area above y=0 is 5/12 * Π3.  Finally double \nthis for the area under y=0 and the total area is 5/6 * Π3 Here is another solution I received from Patrick.

{"id": "prob_098", "type": "math", "difficulty": "2", "title": "Five rectangles in a square problem", "content": "You are to form five rectangles using each integer once from 1 to 10 as the lengths of the sides. How can you tile a square, without overlapping, with the five rectangles? There are four possible answers. Here are the four possible answers, the last one appears in the \npicture below. Go back to Problem 98 Go back to Shack's Math Problems This solution is hard to explain so if you don't understand my \nexplanation please forgive me. First consider the minimum and maximum possible areas the rectangles \ncan cover, not neccessarily forming a square.  The maximum area would \nbe (10*9)+(8*7)+(6*5)+(4*3)+(2*1)=190.  The minimum area would \nbe (10*1)+(9*2)+(8*3)+(7*4)+(6*5)=110.  The three possible squares between \nthese two bounds are 121 (11 by 11), 144 (12 by 12), and 169 (13 by 13). Try to tile a 12 by 12 square.  It makes common sense that one \nrectangle should fit in each corner of the square with the fifth one \nin the middle.  There is no other possibility since the sides of the \nrectangles are all different lengths.  Each side of the square shall \nconsist of the sides of two different rectangles.  Thus the sides \nwill consist of these sums:  10+2, 9+3, 8+4, 7+5.  The middle \nrectangle will be the leftover two numbers, 6 by 1. It also stands to reason that each side of the square will consist of the \nlong side of one rectangle and the short side of another.  To form a \nmiddle rectangle of side 6 we must subtract the side of one rectangle from \nthe side of another, the possibilities being 10-4=6 and 8-2=6.  9-3=6 is \nnot possible since these two dimensions must form a side of the square.  \nIn the 10-4 case we would have the 10+2 side of the square opposite of the \n8+4 side.  The other two opposite sides being 9+3 and 7+5, all odd numbers.  Note that it \nis impossible to subtract one odd number from another and obtain 1.  Thus the \n10-4 case is impossible.  Under the 8-2 case we still have the 10+2 and the 8+4 on \nopposite sides of the square.  Again it will be impossible to form a 1 remainder  \nwith odd numbered sides only the other way.  Thus the 12 by 12 square is impossible \nto tile. The 13 by 13 square will have sides of lengths 10+3, 9+4, 8+5, and 7+6, with a 2 by 1 \nrectangle in the middle.  Through a process of elimination as in the 12 by 12 case \nwe can't help but stumple upon the solutions. The 11 by 11 square can have sides of lengths 10+1, 9+2, 8+3, 7+4, and 6+5.  Four of \nthese will go along the sides and the fifth shall form the middle rectangle.  Again \nit is a process of trial and error to find the solutions. This is a picture of just one solution: Go back to Problem 98 Go back to Shack's Math Problems"}

The cities are 1,000 miles apart. You initially have 10,000 pounds of grain. Your camel may carry up to 1,000 pounds and eats 1 pound of grain per mile traveled. You may leave grain along the way and return to it later. How much grain can you deliever to city B? From the beginning you have enough grain to make 19 one-way trips to some cache point \nalong the way.  The first question is, far out should you transport that grain?  The answer is far enough so that you leave a cache somewhere of \n9000 pounds of grain.  Why 9000?  Every cache point should have some amount of grain \nevenly divisible by 1000.  This way the camel can start out every trip with 1000 pounds, and not \nhave a remainder on the last trip.  So you have 1000 pounds of grain to let the camel eat, divided by 19 one-way trips.  1000 pounds divided by 19 trips is 1000/19=~52.63 pounds, or 52.63 miles per trip.  Each trip you will eat 52.63 miles along the way there, deposit \n894.73 pounds of grain, and take back 52.63 pounds of grain to eat on the way home, except \nthe last trip in which you don't need to return.  The total deposit works out to (10*894.73)+52.63 = 9000 pounds, as arranged.  So you will be \nable to cache 9000 pounds of grain 52.63 miles.

The first car will divide the rest of the street into a small and a \nlarge portion, lets call them s and l.  s is equally likely to range from 0 to 3/2.  l \nis equally likely to range from 3/2 to 3.  The probability that the smaller portion \nis less than 1 is 2/3.  Likewise the probability that smaller portion is greater \nthan 1 is 1/3.  If the smaller portion is greater than 1 then exactly 3 cars will be \nable to park.  If the smaller portion is less than one the number than will be able \nto park is 1+f(l). f(x) = 1/3*3 + 2/3*(1+f(l), where l goes from 2 to 3) = 1 + 2/3*(1 + I(2,3) 1+2*(x-2)/(x-1) dx) = 1 + 2/3 + 2/3 + 4/3*I(2,3) (x-2)/(x-1) dx, next let y=x-1 = 1 + 4/3 * 4/3 * I(1,2) (y-1)/y dy = 7/3 + 4/3 * I(1,2) 1 - 1/y dy = 7/3 + 4/3 * (y-ln(y) for y from 1 to 2) = 7/3 + 4/3 * (2-ln(2)-1+ln(1)) = 7/3 + 4/3 - 4/3*ln(2) = 11/3 - 4/3*ln(2) =~ 2.7425"}

A fourth interior circle is tangent to all three colored circles. What is the radius of the interior circle? For extra credit what is the radius of the exterior circle (not pictured) that is tangent to the three colored circles? The radius of the exterior solution is 6. The triangle marked by the centers of the three outer circles conveniently forms a right triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5 (32 + 42 = 52) as seen by the diagram below. Next draw segments from the center of the interior circle and perpendicular to the outer triangle sides of length 3 and 4. There are four right triangles in this picture, two of which are the same.  Using the pythagorean formula we know: (1):  x2 + y2 = (1+r)2\n(2):  x2 + (3-y)2 = (r+2)2\n(3):  y2 + (4-x)2 = (r+3)2 Combining equations (1) and (2) we get y=(3-r)/3\nCombining equations (1) and (3) we get x=(2-r)/2 Substituting these values for x and y back into equation 1 we get: ((2-r)/2)2 + ((3-r)/3)2 = r2 + 2r + 1 This leads to... 23*r2 + 132r - 36 = 0 Putting this through the quadratic formula we get r=6/23, -6 So the interior circle has radius 6/23 and the outer circle has radius 6. Here is my old solution, as well as some comments from another reader. The solution to this problem is rather hard to explain so I'm only going to go \nover it briefly. First arrange two of the circles so that their centers lay on the y axis.  Then use \nyour trigonomtry to determine the coordinates of the center of the third circle (2.4,-.2) \nif the large circle is on top, the middle circle on bottom, and the third circle is to the \nright.  See problem 92 for help in how to find such coordinates. Second, invert all three circles such that the third circle is mapped onto itself.  Note \nthat the top and bottom circles are mapped to a horizontal lines that are tanjent to the \nthird circle. Note:  To invert any figure take all points (t,r) and map them onto the point \n(t,c/r) where t is the angle in polor coordinates and r is the distance from the \ncenter.  In this case choose the constant c carefully such that the third circle is \nmapped onto itself (okay, c=4.8 in this case). The image of the center circle will be tanjent to both horizontal lines and the \nthird circle.  Going to the right of the third circle will lead us to the interior \ncircle. Consider the line that goes through (0,0) and the center of the circle in the above step.  The \ndistance from the center of the points where this line intersect the circle are sqr(19.4)-1 and \nsqr(19.4)+1.  Invert these two points and their distance from the center are \n4.8/(sqr(19.4)-1) and 4.8/(sqr(19.4)+1).  Both these points lay on a diameter of the interior \ncircle so take their difference and divide by 2 to get the radius.  The answer simplifies \nto 6/23. To find the exterior solution shift the third circle to the left rather than the right.  The \nradius of the exterior solution is exactly 6! Note:  The general case if the third circle has coordinates (x,y) and radius r \nthen the radii of the solution circles are (x2 + y2 - r2) / \n(4xr +/- (x2+y2+3*r2)). The + will determine the interior \nsolution, the - the exterior solution."}

At the scene were between 100 and 200 glasses of wine. Exactly one glass was poisoned. The police lab could test any sampling for poison. A group of glasses could be tested simultaneously by mixing a sample from each glass. The police commissioner desires only to minimize the maximum possible tests required to determine which exact glass was poisoned. The mathematician started by asking a detective to select a single glass at random for testing. \"Wouldn't that waste a test?\", the detective asked. \"No, besides I'm in a gambling mood.\", the mathematician replied. How many glasses were there? If the number of glasses is a power of 2 (32, 64, 128, 256, etc.) then the correct procedure on the first step would be to test exactly half the glasses.  Then test half of the glasses in the positive half next.  Keep repeating this procedure.  Each step will narrow down the field of poisoned glasses by a factor of 2. If the number number of glasses is not a power of 2 then there are lots of ways you can test them and still achieve the same maximum number of tests.  One way would be to find the closest power of 2 less than n, set this many glasses aside, and then test the others.  The only n for which this remainder is 1, between 100 and 200, is 129.  In the case of 129 the first test would likely be negative.  Then proceed with the procedure for testing 128.  Between the first test and the log2128 the maximum number of tests is 8.

Answer many not be expressed in trigonometric functions.  Hint: solve problem problem 47 first. Let x be the height of the pentagon and r be the distance from the center to any corner.  The height of the pentagon was solved in problem 47 as (2*51/2+5)1/2/2.  The area of the pentagon equals 10 times the area of the triangle shown in the following diagram. We already know r so let's solve for x in terms of r using the pythagorean formula on the triangle in the diagram above. (1/2)2 + (x-r)2 = r2 1/4 + x2 -2xr + r2 = r2 1/4 + x2 -2xr = 0 r = 1/(8x) + x/2 So x-r = x/2 - 1/(8x) The area of each triangle is 1/2*base*height = x/8 - 1/(32x) The area of the pentagon is 10 of these triangles = 10x/8 - 10/(32x) = 5x/4 - 5/(16x) = (4x2 - 1)/(32x). We know from problem 47 that x = (2*51/2+5)1/2/2.  Substituting this value for x in the above equation results in an area of (25+10*51/2)1/2/4 =~ 1.7205. The next step is hard to explain without a picture, however I will try.  Consider three consecutive corners of the pentagon and label them a, b, and c.  Next draw a line from a to c.  Call d the point in the middle of segment ac.  Now consider the triangle abd.  This triangle has angles 36, 54, and 90.  We also know the hypotenuse is 1 and longer base is half the distance between any two non-adjacent corners, or (1+sqr(5))/4.  From this we can deduce that cos(36)=(1+sqr(5))/4. Next extend a segment from all five corners of the pentagon and all five midpoints of each side.  This will divide the pentagon into 10 equal triangles.  Each of these triangles conveniently also has angles of 36, 54, and 90.  Next lets define the following: r=distance from any corner of pentagon to center of pentagon\ny=distance from the midpoint of any side to the center of pentagon r+y is the height of the pentagon, which from problem 47 is sqr(5+2*sqr(5))/2. The ratio y/r = cos(36) = (1+sqr(5))/4. Now we have two equations and two unknowns.  At this point we grind out the algebra to find that: r=2*sqr(5+2*sqr(5))/(5+sqr(5))=~0.850651 y=sqr(25+10*sqr(5))/10=~0.688191 The pentagon is composed of 10 right triangles, each of area 1/2*1/2*y.  The area of the pentagon is thus (10/4)*y = sqr(25+10*sqr(5))/4 =~ 1.720477. Thanks to Mark Hoyle for some help with this problem."}
{"id": "prob_124", "type": "math", "difficulty": "3", "title": "Small town election problem", "content": "There exists a small town of 101 people in which John and Richard are running for mayor. Each person in the town (including the two running) cast their vote based on the toss of a fair coin. As the ballots are counted the results are reported vote by vote. The final result is 51 votes for Richard and 50 for John. What is the probability that as the votes were being counted Richard was always ahead? First consider the total number of paths, including those crossing \nthe x axis, which is 50 choose 101 or 101!/(50!*51!).  I will this (101:50). Next consider the number of paths which never touch the x axis, except at the \nbeginning.  Another way to express this is the number of paths from (1,1) to (101,1) minus \nthe number of those ways that every touch the x axis.  Remember the first vote \nmust be for Richard and the path must go to (1,1). The number of paths from (1,1) to (101,1) that ever touch the x axis is \nthe same number of paths that go from (1,-1) to (101,1).  This is the \nhardest step of this problem to explain.  The reason is that any path from \n(1,-1) to (101,1) has a 1:1 counterpart of paths from (1,1) to (101,1) that \ntouch the x axis at least once.  To find the counterpart for any given path just reflect \nthe path from (1,-1) to the point of first contact with the x axis over the x axis \nand keep the rest of the path the same. So the number of paths from (1,1) to (101,1) that never touch the x axis \nis (100:50)-(100:49), where (100:50) is the number of paths from (1,1) to (101,1) \nand (100:49) is the number of paths from (1,-1) to (101,1).  Remember that (100:50) \nis the number of ways to have a 50/50 tie and (100:49) is the number of ways to \nhave a specific person win by two by a vote of 51 to 49. (100:50)-(100:49) = \n100!/(50!*50!) - (100!/(49!*51!) = \n(100!*51)/(51!*50!) - (100!*50)/(50!*51!) = \n100!/(50!*51!) = \n101!/(50!*51!*101) = \n(101:50)/101 . Remember that the total number of possible paths from (0,0) to (101,1) \nwas (101:50) from the second paragraph.  The final answer is the number \nof valid paths divided by the number of total paths = (101:50)/101 / (101:50) = 1/101. In general the probability that a path goes from (0,0) to (x,y) without \never touching the x axis after (0,0) is y/x."}

Each side must have at least one dot. Negative numbers are not allowed. There is another answer besides two standard {1,2,3,4,5,6} dice. Note that the manner of systematically taking the sums of each set of faces is the same as adding exponents when taking the product of (x6+x5+x4+x3+x2+x1)2 = \nx12+\n2x11+\n3x10+\n4x9+\n5x8+\n6x7+\n5x6+\n4x5+\n3x4+\n2x3+\nx2.  The coefficient for xn corresponds to the number of ways a total of n can be thrown. The challenge is to find two other polynomials whose product is also x12+\n2x11+\n3x10+\n4x9+\n5x8+\n6x7+\n5x6+\n4x5+\n3x4+\n2x3+\nx2.  Let's start by factoring each standard die. x6+x5+x4+x3+x2+x1 = \nx*(x5+x4+x3+x2+x1+1) = \nx*(x6-1)/(x-1) = \nx*(x3-1)*(x3+1)/(x-1) = \nx*(x-1)*(x2+x+1)*(x+1)*(x2-x+1)/(x-1) = \nx*(x2+x+1)*(x+1)*(x2-x+1) So the product of two dice is \n(x6+x5+x4+x3+x2+x1)2 = \n(x*(x2+x+1)*(x+1)*(x2-x+1))2 = \nx2*(x2+x+1)2*(x+1)2*(x2-x+1)2 So we want to divide these terms into two sets, one for each die.  There are lots of ways to do this so lets try to narrow down our options.  We know each face has to have at least one dot.  In other other words the polynomial for each die must not have a 1=x0 term, which would correspond to a face with zero dots.  So we have to put on x on each side, otherwise one side would be left with a 1. We also know the number of faces on each die is six.  So each die must have six factors.  If we let x=1 then the polynomial for each die should equal 6.  Let's look at the value of each factor when x=1. x:\t1\nx+1:\t2\nx2-x+1: 1\nx2+x+1: 3 So we want to divide these up into two groups such that the product of the terms equals 6.  We already know we have to put one x on each side.  There is only one way to get to a product of 6 with these constaints: 2*3 = (x+1)*(x2+x+1). So we know each side must contain x*(x+1)*(x2+x+1).  With the (x2-x+1) we are free to do as we wish.  Putting one set on each die results in two standard dice.  So putting two sets on one side and zero on the other results in: x*(x+1)*(x2+x+1) and x*(x+1)*(x2+x+1)*(x2-x+1) 2 = \nx + 2x2 + 2x3 + x4 and x + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6 + x8. So the two dice are {1,2,2,3,3,4} and {1,3,4,5,6,8}. I'd like to thank Nick's Math Puzzles for helping with the solution to this problem.

According to Bayes' theorem this equals Probability(hand contains ace of spades and at least one more ace) / Pr(hand contains ace of spades).  We can break up the numerator as Probability(2 aces including ace of spades) + Probability(3 aces including ace of spades) + Probability(4 aces).  Using the first table this equals 0.039930*(2/4) + 0.001736*(3/4) + 0.000018 = 0.021285.  The probability of the ace of spades is 5/52 = 0.096154.  So the probability of at least two aces given the aces of spades is 0.021285/0.096154 = 0.221369. So the probability of two or more aces given at least one ace is 12.22% and given the ace of spades is 22.14%. Q:  Okay, I believe your numbers but it still doesn't make sense to me. I should think the probabilities would be equal.  What difference does the suit make of the one ace you are given? To make another example suppose you go to Jiffy Lube and they offer two deals for the same price.  Deal A is they will check four parts and replace only the first defective one found.  Deal B is they will check only one problem and fix it if found.  Wouldn't you rather take deal A?  Your car came in with the same number of expected bad parts but the probability of finding a problem is greater under deal A, and thus you will leave with a small number of expected defective parts under that plan.  Likewise a test for any ace will probably turn up the only ace, while a test for the ace of spades does not check for the other three suits, leaving them more likely to be aces."}

{"id": "prob_163", "type": "math", "difficulty": "1", "title": "Large tank with 10 outlets problem", "content": "A large tank has a steadily flowing intake and 10 outlet valves, the latter being all of the same size. With 10 outlets open, it takes two and one half hours to empty the tank; with 6 outlets open it takes five and one half hours to empty the tank. After the tank is empty and with all 10 outlets closed, how long will it take to fill the tank? Thanks to the Baltimore Actuaries Club and Alan Goldberg for this problem. We know that it takes 2.5 hours to empty the tank with 10 valves open.  Over the 2.5 hours the sum of the water in the tank initially and the water going into the tank will equal the amount of water leaving the tank.  Let's set that up as an equation. w + 2.5x = 2.5*10y We also know that it takes 5.5 hours to empty the tank with 6 valves open.  Let's set that up as an equation. w + 5.5x = 5.5*6y I don't like decimals so let's multiply both equations by 2: 2w+5x=50y\n2w+11x=66y To solve the problem we need to know the relationship between w and x, so lets solve for y in the first equation and subsitute in the the second: y=(2w+5x)/50. Substituting this in the second equation... 2w+11x=66*(2w+5x)/50 100w+550x=132w+330x 220x=32w w=220x/32 w=6.875x So 6.875 times the input rate equals the capacity of the tank.  Thus it would take 6.875 hours to fill the tank. Andrew N wrote it to add his two cents on this problem, arguing in real life the rate at which the water leaves will depend on the water pressure in the tank.  Here are his comments. Hi Michael, First off, I'd like to say that you've done a fine job with your math problems website.  The problems are interesting, and the solutions are quite thorough and easy to understand for the most part.  This is no easy feat.  I also love your gambling website, the Wizard of Odds.  You taught me how to play blackjack!  Thanks for that. Now, problem 163 about emptying the water tanks has a physical wrinkle which in missing from the problem statement: if water is constantly entering the tank, there is no way the tank can be emptied.  This is because the flow rate through the outlets is related to the height of the water in the tank.  I can prove this assertion as follows. Setting up Bernoulli's equation for one outlet, where point 1 is the top of the tank and point 2 is on the free jet at the outlet, we have: P1/gamma + v1^2/(2g) + h1 = P2/gamma + v2^2/(2g) + h2 where: P1, P2 are pressures v1, v2 are flow velocities h1, h2 are heights gamma is the specific gravity of water = density * gravity g is the gravitational constant We set h2 equal to 0 as a reference height.  Now, assuming both water surfaces are exposed to the atmosphere, and the height of the tank is not several miles high so atmospheric pressure is constant, we can cancel P1/gamma and P2/gamma.  Also, assuming that the water at the top of the tank is not moving quickly compared to the jet, we can assume v1 = 0.  After simplifying, we are left with: h1 = v2^2/(2g) Solving for v2 we get: v2 = (2g*h1)^0.5 By the continuity equation, the flow rate out from the outlet is equal to the flow velocity v2 times the outlet area A, so: Qout = A*v2 = A*(2g*h1)^0.5 Assuming a cylindrical tank, the volume of water in the tank V is the height of the water h1 times the cross-sectional area R, so: Qout = A*[2g*(V/R)]^0.5 = k*(V^0.5) for simplicity's sake. Now that we have an expression for the flow rate out of the outlet as a function of the volume in the tank, we can set up a differential equation to solve for the volume in the tank as a function of time. change in volume = flow in - flow out dV/dt = Qin - n*Qout (<-- n outlets, all assumed to flow at the same rate) dV/dt = Qin - n*k*(V^0.5) This is a seperable differential equation.  Seperating both parts we get: dV/(Qin - n*k*(V^0.5)) = dt Integrating both sides, we get: (1/nk)^2 * [2*(V0^0.5 - V^0.5) + 2*Qin*LN[(Qin - nk*V0^0.5)/(Qin - nk*V^0.5)]] = t The interesting thing here is that if Qin = nk*V^0.5, or V = (Qin/nk)^2, then the LN part of this equation will be undefined.  Values of V less than (Qin/nk)^2 give negative values for t, which are clearly not possible.  The physical explanation for this is that as the volume in the tank is reduced, there is not enough driving force (hydrostatic pressure in this case) to evacuate the fluid in the tank at a faster rate than it's coming in.  In effect, it is not possible to empty the tank so long as water in flowing in.  I used a cylindrical tank as the basis for this proof for simplicity, but this principle applies to any shaped tank. Just my 2 cents. Thanks, Andrew N"}

Each cow eats at a constant rate. The length of the grass before the cows begin grazing is constant. How many days will it take 16 cows to eat 7 acres of grass? By the time the cows have eaten all the grass total grass consumed will equal total initial grass plus total grass regrowth.  Next lets define some terms. x=initial amount of grass in an acre.\ny=amount of grass grown in one acre in one day. Putting the given information in the form of equations we get: 50=2x+20y\n210=3x+90y To put the first equation in more simple English, 5 cows eating for 10 days results in a consumption of 50 units of grass.  This is equal to the sum of 2x initial units of grass and 20y units of grass growth (10 days times 2 acres). Next we must solve for x and y.  Rewriting the above equations we get: 150=6x+60y (multiplying by 3)\n420=6x+180y (multiplying by 2) Subtracting the first equation from the second we get 270=120y, so y=9/4.  Plugging this into either equation we get x=5/2. The question to be answered is \"How many days will it take 16 cows to eat 7 acres of grass?\"  Let's let d be the number of days.

The number of ways to get from A to C, including those ways passing through B, is less than 300. How many ways are there to get from A to C? Let's define the number of direct routes from A to B as x.\nLet's define the number of direct routes from B to C as y.\nLet's define the number of direct routes from A to C as z. From the information given we know:\nx + yz = 82\ny + xz = 62 Adding them we get:\nx + xz + y + yz = 144\n(x + y) * (z + 1) = 144 and subtract them to get:\nx - xz - y + yz = 20\n(y - x) * (z - 1) = 20 The factors of 20 are {1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20}.  So (z - 1) is one of {1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20}.\nthen (z + 1) is one of {3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 22}. The factors of 144 are: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 144}.  So (z + 1) must be one of these factors. Common possible (z + 1) values are {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12}.\n\nGiven (x + y) * (z + 1) = 144, possible values of (x + y) are:  {144, 64, 48, 36, 24, 12}. \nPossible values of (z - 1) are: {-1, 0, 1, 2, 4, 10}.\nConcurrently since (y - x) * (z - 1) = 20, then possible values of (y - x) are: {20, 10, 5, 2, -20}. This leads to five possible solutions.  Note that x+y=64 is not listed because then z would be 1 and (y-x)*(z-1) could not equal 20 for any values of x and y. The fourth solutions is not possible because there can not be half a path.  The problem limits us to z+xy<300, so that eliminates the first three.  Thus the fifth solution is the correct one. If x=5, y=7, and z=11 then the final answer is z+xy=11+5*7=46. Let's define the distance from A to B as x.\nLet's define the distance from B to C as y.\nLet's define the distance from A to C as z. The information given tells us that: x+yz=82\ny+xz=62\nz+xy<300 Combining the first two equations and solving for z we get: z=(82-x)/y, and z=(62-y)/x Equating the two we get x/y = (62-y)/(82-x) Unfortunately trial and error seems the only solution from here.  The way I did it was to create a spreadsheet with values of x along one axis and values of y along the other.  In the body of the spreadsheet I had the following formula (62-y)/(82-x) - (x/y).  Then I simply looked for a zero. If your ranges for x and y are small then the values x=5 and y=7 should pop out, which lead to the correct solution.  However other values that work are (x,y)=(13,23), (14,28), (14,34), (12,42), (5,55). The problem tell us that z+xy<300.  Multiplying x and y easily eliminates all possible values except (5,7) and (13,23).  If x=23 and y=23 then z is easily solved as 3.  In this case the total paths from A to C would be 3+13*23=302, which is too many. So x=5 and y=7.  Simple algebra tells us that z=11.  So 11+5*7 = 46."}

What is the speed of the slow train, in miles per hour? Assume first the slow train leaves late.  At the moment the slow train does leave the fast train will be at point 3x-2u.  The meeting point will be 1/3 of the way between 0 and 3x-2u = (3x-2u)/3 = x-2u/3.  We also know the distance from this point to x is 2 miles.  In other words x-(x-2u/3)=2 ... 2u/3=2... u=3.

Credit for this problem goes to Martin Gardner who published it in the November 1965 Scientific American. From clues 1 and 2 we can infer that a king is on the left and a queen on the right and the middle card is either a queen or 2. First consider the possibility that a 2 is in the middle.   If there are two consecutive spades (from clue 4) then then three cards must be the king of spades, 2 of spades, queen of hearts.  If to the right of a spade there is a 2 (again from rule 4) then the three cards are the kings of spades, a two of unknown suit, and the queen of hearts.  So if we assume a 2 in the middle it is not certain what the suit of the 2 is. Next consider the possibility that a queen is in the middle.  Clue 4 tells us there must be two consecutive spades, since there is no 2.  Both queens can not be spades since they are from the same deck, thus the left and center cards must be spades.  Clue 3 tells us the right queen is a heart.  So the three cards would be the king of spades, queen of spades, and queen of hearts. So a 2 in the middle does not lead to a definitive answer, but a queen in the middle does.  The question implies there is just one possible answer.  Therefore there is a queen in the middle, leading to the final answer of king of spades, queen of spades, and queen of hearts.

However since m' and w' are integers then d' is also an integer and can not be 101/2.  For the same reason (25,4) and (20,5) are not possible because the sum of the two factor is odd. Let's consider (10,10).  Then d'+d=10, d'-d = 10 --> d=0 --> m-w=0.  However the problem stated m>w, so (10,10) doesn't work. That leaves only (d'+d,d'-d)=(50,2).  Adding the two equations gives us d'=m'-w'=26. Remember, d'2 = m'+w', so m'+w'=262 = 676. Remember also that m'-w'=26 Adding the two equations give us 2m'=702 --> m'=351 --> w'=325.

{"id": "prob_175", "type": "math", "difficulty": "4", "title": "Five ants on a pentagon problem", "content": "Five ants are on the corners of an equilateral pentagon with side of length 1. They each crawl directly towards the next ant, all at the same speed and traveling in the same orientation. How long will each ant travel before they all meet in the center? It is intuitive that at all times the ants will form the corners of a square, ever decreasing in size and rotating about the center. Let C be the center of the square at point (0,0).  Let the ants be at initial points (.5,.5), (.5,-.5), (-.5,-.5), and (-.5,.5).  Let ant 1 bet at (.5,-.5) who is chasing ant 2 at (.5,.5).  Consider the line from C to ant 1.  Next consider the line from ant 1 to ant 2.  The angle between these lines is 135 degrees. Theorem:  Let C be a fixed point, D a point on a curve, r the distance from C to D, x the polar angle formed by r, and y the angle formed by the angle between CD and the tangent line to the curve at point D.  Then tan(y)=r/(dr/dx). So the line of sight from the center to the initial point of ant 1 would be be at a 270 degree angle.  The line of sight from ant 1 to ant 2 would be a vertical line of 90 degrees.  The angle between these lines is 270 degrees.  The tangent of 270 is -1.  So we have r/(dr/dx) = -1.  Thus r(x)=c*e-x. At the moment the ants start walking x equals 0.  At this moment the distance from the center to any of the ants is 2-1/2.  So r(x)=2-1/2*e-x. The arc length is given by the formula:  \nIntegral from negative infinity to 0 of ((f(x))2+(f'(x))2)1/2 = \n\nIntegral from negative infinity to 0 of ((2-1/2*e-x)2 + (-2-1/2*e-x)2)1/2 = \n\nIntegral from negative infinity to 0 of (2-1*e-2x + 2-1*e-2x)1/2 = \n\nIntegral from negative infinity to 0 of e-x = \n\n-e-x from negative infinity to 0 = \n\n=0 - (-e0) = \n\n0 -(-1) = 1. The easy way to solve this problem is to first note that the direction of one ant will always be perpendicular to the path of the ant he is chasing.  If ant A is chasing ant B then B has zero velocity in the direction of A's path.  In other words B neither approaches nor\nrecedes from A during the walk.  So it is like A is walking directly towards an unmoving ant B, in which case the total distance is simply the intial separation of 1. No we're ready to consider the pentagon case.  Whether you solve the square case the easy or the hard way it should be clear that as ant A chases ant B what is important is the velocity of ant B relative to the path of ant A. Before we go further we have to do some trigonometry.  Consider an equilateral pentagon of side 1 with the first vertice at (0,0) and the second at (1,0).  Where is the third vertice?  Given that the interior angles of a pentagon are 108 degrees the next vertice is at (1+cos(72),sin(72)). So as ant A inches 1 unit towards ant B, ant B will move cos(72) units directly away from ant A in the same direction and sin(72) in a perpenticular direction.  We know form the four corners problem that the perpenticular direction can be ignorred.  So for every micron ant A moves towards ant B, ant B will move away from ant A by cos(72) microns. The total distance covered by A, or any ant, is the sum for i=0 to infinity of cos(72)i.  We know from infinite sums that this equals 1/(1-cos(72)). If you prefer to express the answer another way cos(72)=1/(1+51/2).  So 1/(1-cos(72)) = 1/(1-1/(1+51/2)) = 1/((51/2)/(1+51/2)) = (1+51/2)/51/2 = 1 + 1/51/2 =~ 1.4472 . For more information on this problem please see the November 1957 and July 1965 issues of Scientific American.  The July 1965 issue notes that for the general case of an n-gon the total distance is as follows.  Let A and B be the initial points of any two consecutive ants, where A is chasing B.  Let C be the center of the n-gon.  Consider the line segment AB extended to a point X, such that the angle XCA is a right angle.  The total distance any ant will travel is the same as the distance from A to X. Thus, if the interior angle of the n-gon is x then the total distance is 1/(1+cos(x)).  So for an n-gon the total distance is 1/[1+cos(180-360/n)]."}

You are given: The boy should get $2000/(9+851/2) = $109.77 First let's define some terms: m = man's shaking speed per hour\nb = boy's gathering speed per hour\nr = ratio of the time man is shaking, if they decide to have a man as shaker. Let's look at the number of apples gathered if one of the men is the shaker for a ratio r of the time. r×(200+b) + (1-r)×(300+b) = 300\n200r + rb + 300 + b -300r - rb = 300\nb - 100r = 0\n100r = b\n(1) r = b/100 Next, let's look at the fact that a man can shake 25% faster than two men and the boy can gather them.  Assume he does this for ratio r of the hous.  Then the number of apples shaken is: r×(5/4)×(200+b) = 300\n(b/100)×(5/4)×(200+b) = 300 Substituting equation (1) for r\nb×(5/4)×(200+b) = 30,000\nb×(200+b) = 24,000\nb22 + 200b - 24,000=0\n\nUsing the quadradic formula: b = [-200 +/- sqr(40,000+96,000)]/2 = 84.3909 We're given that m = 1.25×(200+b).  We know b, so we can solve for m: m = 1.25×(200+84.3909)\nm = 355.4886 So, the man can shake 355.4886/300 = 18.5% faster than the boy. The man can also gather 100/84.3909 = 18.5% faster than the boy. It stands to reason he should get paid 18.5% more as well. Dividing up the $500, let:\n\nm' = man's pay\nb' = boy's pay 500 = 3m' + b'\n500 = 3×1.185×b' + b'\n500 = 4.555 b'\nb' = $109.77\n\nThat leaves $500-$109.77 = $390.23 between the three men.

What is the probability that a dollar bill chosen at random will contain all 3 of your numbers in the serial number? Note: the serial number has 8 digits, you may assume that an equal number of each combination is in circulation. The number of ways the serial number can contain none of the three numbers, or be composed of only digits 0 to 6 is 78. The number of ways the serial number can contain at least one 7 but no 8 or 9 is 88-78.  We must subtract 78 because there are that many numbers that contain only the digits 0 to 6 but no 7.  Likewise the number of ways to add at least one 8 or one 9 is also 88-78.  So the number of ways the serial numbers will contain just one digit out of {7,8,9} is 3*(88-78). Now let's consider the number of ways the serial number can have at least one 7 and 8 but no 9.  The number of all combinations leaving out the 9 is 98.  However some of those have no 7 or 8 digits.  The number of combinations with 7 but no 8 is 88-78.  This is also the number of combinations with 8 but no 7.  We must also subtract the number of combinations with only 0-6, which is 78.  So the number of combinations with at least one 7 and one 8, but no 9, is 98-2*(88-78)-78.  Mutliply this by three for the number of ways the serial number can omit the 7 and 8 but leave the other two chosen numbers.  So the probability the serial number will have 2 out of our 3 numbers is 3*(98-2*(88-78)-78). So the probability that the serial number will not contain all three chosen numbers is:\n\n(78 + \n3*(88-78) + \n3*(98-2*(88-78)-78)))/108 = \n\n (3*98-3*88+78)/108 = 0.84573316. To get the probability will contain all three chosen numbers just subtract the number above from one, or 1 - (3*98-3*88+78)/108 = 0.15426684."}

The area inside the field, which can be covered by at least one sheep, is xy/2. The part of the sheep's area which the dog can cover is everything on the side of the hypotenuse containing the field, or pi*(z/2)2/2.

When they arrive home the man notices that they arrived 20 minutes earlier than usual. How much time did the man spend walking? I found this problem in Games for the Super-Intelligent by James F. Fixx, which is out of print. Suppose the husband usually took the train that arrived at 5:00, but today took the one that arrived at 4:00.  Since the wife would have spent all her time driving at the same speed it stands to reason she saved 10 minutes both directions because her husband walked part of the way. So, if the wife usually arrived at the station at 5:00 then she would have spotted her husband at 4:50.  The husband started walking at 4:00, thus he would have spent 50 minutes walking.

During their first day they gather coconuts and put them all in a community pile. After working all day they decide to sleep and divide them into two equal piles the next morning. That night one castaway wakes up hungry and decides to take his share early. After dividing up the coconuts he finds he is one coconut short of ten equal piles. He also notices the monkey holding one more coconut. So he tries to take the monkey's coconut to have a total evenly divisible by 10. However when he tries to take it the monkey conks him on the head with it and kills him. Later another castaway wakes up hungry and decides to take his share early. On the way to the coconuts he finds the body of the first castaway, which pleases him because he will now be entitled to 1/9 of the total pile. After dividing them up into nine piles he is again one coconut short and tries to take the monkey's coconut. Again, the monkey conks the man on the head and kills him. One by one each of the remaining castaways goes through the same process, until the 10th person to wake up gets the entire pile for himself. What is the smallest number of possible coconuts in the pile, not counting the monkeys? We know from the second man that that total must be one less than a number divisible by 9. After considering all 10 people the final number must be one less than a number divisible by every number from 1 to 10.  Certainly 10!=3628800 works but there is smaller solutions.  The smallest answer is LCM(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)-1 = 7*2*2*2*3*3*5-1 = 2519. Note that LCM stands for Least Common Multiple. Thanks to David Brown for suggesting this problem."}

The integral of 1/x from 0.5 to 0.8 is ln(0.8)-ln(0.5).  The integral from 1/(x-1) from 0.5 to 0.8 = ln(x-1) from 0.5 to 0.8 = \nln(-0.2)-ln(-0.5) = ln(-1)+ln(.2)-(ln(-1)+ln(.5)) = ln(.2)-ln(.5).  So the initial expression equals 0.16*(ln(0.2)-ln(0.5)-(ln(0.8)-ln(0.5))) = 0.16*(ln(0.2)-ln(0.8)) = 0.16*ln(.2/.8) = 0.16*ln(1/4) = -0.16*ln(4)=-0.32*ln(2).

Integral (3) is the tough one.  My copy of C.R.C. Standard Mathematical Tables, which I got on Ebay, says that the integral of 1/X, where X=a+bx+cx2 and q=4ac-b2, is -2/sqr(-q)*tanh-1((2cx+b)/sqr(-q)). In the case of a=0, b=-1, c=1 the integral works out to 0.16*tanh-1x.  Given the bounds of 0.5 to 0.8 the area under the curve is 0.16*-2*tanh-10.6 My copy of C.R.C. Standard Mathematical Tables also reminds me that tanh-1(x) = ln(1+x)/2 - ln(1-x)/2.  So (3) equals 0.16*-2*(ln(1.6)/2 - ln(0.4)/2) = -0.16*(ln(1.6)-ln(0.4)) = -0.16*ln(4) So the final answer is 2*(0.3+ln(0.4)-ln(0.4)-0.16*ln(4)) = 2*(0.3-0.16*ln(4)) = (15-8*ln(4))/25 = (15-16*ln(2))/25 =~ 0.156386"}

Every time the game is played the contestant first picks a door. Then the host will open one of the other two doors and always reveals a goat. Then the host gives the player the option to switch to the other unopened door. Should the player switch? The key to this problem is that the host is predestined to open a door with a goat.  He knows which door has the car so regardless of which door the player picks he always can reveal a goat behind another door. Let's assume that the prize is behind door 1.  Following are what would happen if the player had a strategy of not switching. Following are what would happen if the player had a strategy of switching. So by not switching the player has 1/3 chance of winning.  By switching the player has a 2/3 chance of winning.  So the player should definitely switch. The plain simple English reason the probability of winning increases to 66.67% by switching, lays in the fact that the host always reveals a goat.  If the host didn't know which door had the car, then the probability of having a win would go up to 50% after revealing one of the goats.  Such is the case on the show \"Deal or no Deal.\"  On that show, the host does not know where the million dollar case is.  So, as cases are eliminated that do not have the million dollars, the probability increases that every remaining case has it, equally.  When there are only two cases left and two prizes, each case has a 50% chance of each prize. Links"}

The soldier at the front of the column has to deliver a message to the soldier at the rear. He breaks rank and begins marching toward the rear at a constant rate while the column continues forward. The soldier reaches the rear, delivers the message and immediately turns to march forward at a constant rate. When he reaches the front of the column and drops back in rank, the column has moved one mile. Question- How far did the soldier delivering the message march? Let r2 = rate of the messanger. d = distance covered by messanger. t = time to move one mile = 1 hour. The meeting point of the messanger and the person at the rear is a distance of r2/(1+r2) from the starting point of the messanger.  This is just the ratio of the messanger's rate divided by the sum of the two rates. The messanger will have to cover the distance to the meeting point, turn around and cover it again, and then march one more mile.  So... d = 2*r2/(1+r2). distance = rate * time, so... 2*r2/(1+r2) = r2*1 2*r2/(1+r2) = r2 -1 2*r2 = r22 -1 r22 - 2*r2 - 1 = 0 Use the quadratic equation to solve for r2... r2 = (2 + 81/2)/2 = 1+21/2 =~ 2.4142 miles/hr Since he is marching for one hour is distance is 2.4142 miles.

How can you get the same number of coins tails up on both tables with at least one penny on each table? First, move any 20 pennies to the other table, keeping the same side on each penny up. Second, flip all 20 pennies on the other table. Explanation Initially table 1 will have 80 heads and 20 tails, and table 2 will have 0 heads and 0 tails. Let t be the number tails moved, and h be the number of heads. After the move table 1 will have 80-h heads and 20-t tails, and table 2 will have h heads and t tails. After the flip table 1 will have 80-h heads and 20-t tails, and table 2 will have t heads and h tails. So, at this point table 1 has 20-t tails and table 2 has h tails.  We moved 20 coins: h heads, and t tails, so h+t=20, or h=20-t.  20-t and h must be the same amount, thus both tables have the same number of tails, although we don't know what that number is.

Thanks to J.F.W. from Marshall for this problem. The probability that any given number will not have hit is (37/38)200 = 0.48%. With 38 numbers, we could incorrectly say that the probability that any one of them would not be hit is 38 × (37/38)200 = 18.34%. The reason this is incorrect is it double counts two numbers not being hit.  So we need to subtract those probabilities out.  There are combin(38,2) = 703 sets of 2 numbers out of 38.  The probability of not hitting any two given numbers is (36/38)200 = 0.000020127.  We need to subtract the probability of avoiding both numbers.  So we are at: 38×(37/38) 200 - combin(38,2)×(36/38) 200 = 16.9255%. However, now we have canceled out the probability of three numbers not hitting.  For any given group of three numbers we triple counted the probability of any single number not being hit.  We then triple subtracted for each way to choose two numbers out of the three, leaving with zero for the probability that all three numbers were not hit.  There are combin(38,3)=8,436 such groups.  Adding them back in we are now at: 38×(37/38) 200 - combin(38,2)×(36/38) 200 + combin(38,3)×(35/38)200  = 16.9862%. Yet, now we have over-counted the probability of four numbers not hitting.  For each of the combin(38,4)=73,815 groups of four numbers, each was originally quadruple counted.  Then we subtracted each of the combin(4,2)=6 groups of 2 out of the 4.  Then we added back in the 4 groups of 3 out of the 4.  So, for each union of four numbers, it was counted 4 � 6 + 4 = 2 times.  To adjust for the double counting we must subtract for each group.  Subtracting them out we are now at: 38×(37/38) 200 - \ncombin(38,2)×(36/38) 200 + \ncombin(38,3)×(35/38)200 - \ncombin(38,4)×(34/38)200 \n= 16.9845%. Continuing in the process we would keep alternating adding and subtracting, all the way until missing 37 numbers.  Thus the probability of at least one number never being hit is: Sum i=1 to 37 [(-1)(i+1) × combin(38,i) × ((38-i)/38)38] = 16.9845715651245% Here are the results of a random simulation of 126,900,000 such 200-spin experiments. The ratio of times at least one number was not hit was 0.169833. Thanks to J.F.W. from Marshall for this problem."}

{"id": "prob_198", "type": "logic", "difficulty": "3", "title": "Three logicians game #1", "content": "You are playing a game with two perfect logicians. All three must secretly write down a positive integer. The one with the lowest unique integer will win $3. If all three have the same number, each will win $1. The logicians are selfish, and each wishes to maximize his own winnings. Communication is not allowed. What number should you choose? You should have a random strategy in which you choose x with probability (1/2)x. A random strategy is called for, to prevent the other two logicians from exploiting a non-random choice. For example, if logician A had a firm strategy to choose the number 1, B and C could gain an advantage by choose 1 with probability 75%, and 2 with probability 25%.  The following would be the possible outcomes under that scenario: B picks 1, C picks 1:  probability 0.75×0.75 = 0.5625, A gets $1, B gets $1, C gets $1.\nB picks 1, C picks 2:  probability 0.75×0.25 = 0.1875, A gets $0, B gets $0, C gets $3.\nB picks 2, C picks 1:  probability 0.25×0.75 = 0.1875, A gets $0, B gets $3, C gets $1.\nB picks 2, C picks 2:  probability 0.25×0.25 = 0.0625, A gets $3, B gets $0, C gets $0. Expected value for A = 0.5625×1 + 0.0625×3 = $0.75.\nExpected value for B or C = 0.5625×1 + 0.1875×3 = $1.125. The optimal strategy is the one that can not be defeated by any other strategy used by both the other logicians. Now, this is where I use some hand waiving logic, but I contend that if two logicians use this same strategy, it won't make any difference what the third logician does, the expected value will be equal for all three. Let's start by consider the case where the only choices are 1 and 2. Obviously, the only way to win would be to be the singleton in a split game. There is no difference between 1 and 2. So the correct strategy would be to pick 1 or 2 randomly, with 50% each. Next, let's introduce a third choice. If at least one logician picks 1, the game will be decided for that reason. If none pick number 1, then it reverts to the two-number game of the last step. Let p be the probability that logicians A or B pick number 1. Logician C should be indifferent to picking 1 or not. If he doesn't, then he should revert to the 50/50 strategy of the 2-number game, because it will only come into play if nobody picks 1. The expected value of logician C picking 1 is $1×p^2 + $3×(1-p)2. The expected value of C not picking 1 is $1×(1-p)^2 + $3×p^2. So, we have $1×p^2 + $3×(1-p)^2 = $1×(1-p)^2 + $3×p^2. Doing some simply algebra, we get p=0.5. So, in the 3-number case, the probability of picking 1 is 50%, 2 is 25%, and 3 is 25%. Next, let's introduce a fourth choice. Again, if at least one logician picks 1, the game will be decided for that reason. If none pick number 1, then it reverts to the three-number game of the last step. Let p be the probability that logicians A or B pick number 1. Logician C should be indifferent to picking 1 or not. If he doesn't, then he should revert to the 50/25/25 strategy of the 3-number game, because it will only come into play if nobody picks 1. Again, the expected value of logician C picking 1 is $1×p^2 + $3×(1-p)^2. The expected value of C not picking 1 is $1×(1-p)^2 + $3×p^2. So, we have $1×p^2 + $3×(1-p)^2 = $1×(1-p)^2 + $3×p^2. The equation is the same as the 3-number game, so p will still be 0.5. So, in the 4-number case, the probability of picking 1 is 50%, 2 is 25%, 3 is 12.5%, and 4 is 12.5%. Repeating this logic, the probability of number 1 will always be 50%, and the other numbers will shift down 1, and be divided by 2. Done infinitely, the probability of x (where x>1) will be the probability half of the probability of x-1. So, the probability of picking n is (1/2)^n."}

Four teams in the National League will make the playoffs, the three division leaders, and a wild card team.  The wild card team is the team with the best record in the league, not including the three division leaders.  Assuming all teams are equally good, what is the probability of a team in each division making the playoffs?  Assume any ties are broken randomly. Solution The difficult part of this question is determing the probability that the Wild Card team will fall in any given division.  Let's consider the American League East first.  There are six ways the wild card team could be in the American League East, as follows. American League East has both first and second place teams in the entire American League.  The probability of this is (5/14)×(4/13) = 10.9890%. American League East has both first and third place teams, but not the second, in the entire American League.  The probability of this is (5/14)×(4/13)×(9/12) = 8.2418%. American League East has both second and third place teams, but not the first, in the entire American League.  The probability of this is (5/14)×(4/13)×(9/12) = 8.2418%. American League East has both first and fourth place teams, in the entire American League, and the second and third place teams fall one each into the other two divisions.  The probability of this is = (5/14)×(4/13)×((5/12)×(4/11)+(4/12)×(5/11)) = 3.3300%. American League East has both second and fourth place teams, in the entire American League, and the first and third place teams fall one each into the other two divisions.  The probability of this is = (5/14)×(4/13)×((5/12)×(4/11)+(4/12)×(5/11)) = 3.3300%. American League East has both third and fourth place teams, in the entire American League, and the first and second place teams fall one each into the other two divisions.  The probability of this is = (5/14)×(4/13)×((5/12)×(4/11)+(4/12)×(5/11)) = 3.3300%. Add these probabilties together and you get 37.4625%.  It is obvious the probability should be the same for the American League Central.  The probability for the American League West thus has a probability of 100% - 2×37.4625% = 25.074925% of having the wild card team. The probability any given team will be a division leader is 20% in the East and Central divisions, and 25% in the West division.  These are also the probabilities for the wild card spot, given that it is in the same division.  So, the probability that a team from the East or Central divisions makes the playoffs is 20% + 37.4625%×20% = 27.492500%.  The probability that a team from the West division makes the playoffs is 25% + 25.074925%×25% = 31.268731%. Extra Credit The probability the National League East or West division will get the wild card is 29.670330% each, and 40.659341% for the Central division.  The probability any given team in the East or West will make the playoffs is 25.934066%, and 23.443223% for Central.

What is the probability the 12 is rolled first? Let's call p the probability that a 12 is rolled first from the first roll, or at any time when the last roll was not a 7. Let's call q the probability that a 12 is rolled first when the last roll was a 7.

We also know that one blue amoea will spawn into 0.6508 red amoeba on average.  However, that doesn't tell us how many blue amoeba a red amoeba will spawn into.  To answer that question, let's redefine the variables as follows: Let r = expected number of blue amoeba observed per initial red amoeba.\nLet b = expected number of blue amoeba observed per initial blue amoeba. Putting the initial conditions into equations: r = 0.3r + 0.33b \nb = 1 + 0.2b + 0.3r Using algebra to solve the equations we get: r = 330/461 =~ 0.7158\nb = 700/461 =~ 1.5184 So, one red amoeba will spawn into 0.7158 blue amoeba on average.

Solution The obvious plays are neither player should call with the ace, always call with the trey, and never bet with a deuce.  By raising with a deuce, you will win $1 against an ace, because your opponent will fold, and lose $2 against a trey, because he will raise.  A superior strategy with a deuce is to always check, and then to always call if the other player bets. By following the check and call strategy, you'll win $2 instead of $1 against an ace, and stay equal against a trey at a $2 loss.  If your opponent checks with the ace, you'll still win $1, and be no worse off.  You can only gain by checking and calling with a deuce. There are five other, more difficult, decision points to be faced by both players, as follows: The key to game theory problems like this is to put your opponent to an indifference point at non-obvious decisions.  If the odds favor one way or the other, the person making the decision will always go with the odds, and gain an advantage.  To do that, let's express player 1's expected value. EV1 = \npr(player 1 has A)×pr(player 2 has 2)×pr(player 1 checks)×pr(player 2 checks)×-1 + \npr(player 1 has A)×pr(player 2 has 2)×pr(player 1 bets)×pr(player 2 folds)×+1 + \npr(player 1 has A)×pr(player 2 has 2)×pr(player 1 bets)×pr(player 2 calls)×-2 + \n\npr(player 1 has A)×pr(player 2 has 3)×pr(player 1 checks)×pr(player 2 bets)×pr(player 1 folds)×-1 + \npr(player 1 has A)×pr(player 2 has 3)×pr(player 1 bets)×pr(player 2 calls)×-2 + \n\npr(player 1 has 2)×pr(player 2 has A)×pr(player 1 checks)×pr(player 2 checks)×+1 + \npr(player 1 has 2)×pr(player 2 has A)×pr(player 1 checks)×pr(player 2 bets)×pr(player 1 folds)×-1 + \npr(player 1 has 2)×pr(player 2 has A)×pr(player 1 checks)×pr(player 2 bets)×pr(player 1 calls)×+2 + \n\npr(player 1 has 2)×pr(player 2 has 3)×pr(player 1 checks)×pr(player 2 bets)×pr(player 1 folds)×-1 + \npr(player 1 has 2)×pr(player 2 has 3)×pr(player 1 checks)×pr(player 2 bets)×pr(player 1 calls)×-2 + \n\npr(player 1 has 3)×pr(player 2 has A)×pr(player 1 checks)×pr(player 2 checks)×+1 + \npr(player 1 has 3)×pr(player 2 has A)×pr(player 1 checks)×pr(player 2 bets)×pr(player 1 calls)×+2 + \npr(player 1 has 3)×pr(player 2 has A)×pr(player 1 bets)×pr(player 2 folds)×+1 \n\npr(player 1 has 3)×pr(player 2 has 2)×pr(player 1 checks)×pr(player 2 checks)×+1 + \npr(player 1 has 3)×pr(player 2 has 2)×pr(player 1 bets)×pr(player 2 folds)×+1 \npr(player 1 has 3)×pr(player 2 has 2)×pr(player 1 bets)×pr(player 2 calls)×+2 EV1 = \n(1/3)×(1/2)×(1-p1)×1×-1 + \n(1/3)×(1/2)×p1×(1-q2)×1 + \n(1/3)×(1/2)×p1×q2×-2 +\n\n(1/3)×(1/2)×(1-p1)×1×1×-1 +\n(1/3)×(1/2)×p1×1×-2 +\n\n(1/3)×(1/2)×1×(1-q1)×1 +\n(1/3)×(1/2)×1×q1×(1-p2)×-1 +\n(1/3)×(1/2)×1×q1×p2×2 +\n\n(1/3)×(1/2)×1×1×(1-p2)×-1 +\n(1/3)×(1/2)×1×1×p2×-2 +\n\n(1/3)×(1/2)×(1-p3)×(1-q1)×1 +\n(1/3)×(1/2)×(1-p3)×q1×1×2 +\n(1/3)×(1/2)×p3×1×1 + \n\n(1/3)×(1/2)×(1-p3)×1×1 +\n(1/3)×(1/2)×p3×(1-q2)×1 +\n(1/3)×(1/2)×p3×q2×2 EV1 = (1/6)×(\n-1+p1\n+p1-p1q2\n-2p1q2\n\n-1+p1\n-2p1\n\n+1-q1\n-q1+q1p2\n+2q1p2\n\n-1+p2\n-2p2\n\n1-q1-p3+p3q1\n+2q1-2p3q1\n+p3\n\n+1-p3\n+p3-p3q2\n+2p3q2) = (1/6)×(p1-q1-p2-3p1q2+3q1p2-p3q1+p3q2) Equation 1\n= (1/6)×[q1×(-1+3p2-p3) + q2×(-3p1+p3) + p1-p2] What values for q1 and q2 will make EV1 equal to a constant, causing player 1 to be indifferent to all values of p1, p2, and p3? The answer is q1=1/3, and q2=1/3, so... EV1 = (1/6)×[(1/3)×(-1+3p2-p3) + (1/3)×(-3p1+p3) + p1-p2] \n= (1/6)×[-1/3 +p2 -p3/3 - p1 +p3/3 +p1 -p2] \n= (1/6)×(-1/3) \n= -1/18 So, player 2 should bluff with an ace after a check, and call with a deuce, each with probability 1/3.  If player 2 does that, it won't make any difference what player 1 does at his three difficult decision points, his overall expected value will be -1/18. Next, what should player's 1 optimal strategy be, so that player 2 can't exploit a bad strategy?  Let's go back to equation 1.  The expected value of player 2 will be the opposite of the expected value of player 1.  So... EV2 = (-1/6)×(p1-q1-p2-3p1q2+3q1p2-p3q1+p3q2) =\nEV2 = (-1/6)×[p1×(1-3q2)+p2×(3q1-1)+p3×(q2-q1)-q1] Next, determine values for p1, p2, and p3 so that the q1 and q2 terms cancel out, leaving a constant.  This will result in a strategy where player 2 is indifferent at the difficult decision points. If 3p2-p3=1, then the q1 terms will cancel out.\nIf 3p1=p3, then then q2 terms will cancel out. So, two equations must be satisfied.  Examples of values that work are p1=1/5, p2=8/15, p3=3/5.

Please give an expression of the answer and/or a numeric answer. Answer Solution There are four possible states the shooter can be in.  Let's define them as follows. State 1 = Come out roll \nState 2 = Point of 4 or 10\nState 3 = Point of 5 or 9\nState 4 = Point of 6 or 8 The probabilities are recursive.  Let p(x,r) represent the probability of being in state x before roll r.  Based on simple dice probabilities, p(x,r) can be expressed as follows: (1) P(1,r) = (12/36)×p(1,r-1) + (3/36)×p(2,r-1) + (4/36)×p(3,r-1) + (5/36)× p(4,r-1) \n(2) P(2,r) = (6/36)×p(1,r-1) + (27/36)×p(2,r-1) \n(3) P(3,r) = (8/36)×p(1,r-1) + (26/36)×p(3,r-1) \n(4) P(4,r) = (10/36)×p(1,r-1) + (25/36)×p(4,r-1) In more plain simple English, equation (1) is saying that the probability of being in a come out roll before roll r is the sum of the following: Equation (2) is saying the probability of rolling for a 4 or 10 before roll r is the sum of: Equation (3) is saying the probability of rolling for a 5 or 9 before roll r is the sum of: Equation (4) is saying the probability of rolling for a 6 or 8 before roll r is the sum of: Next, let's express the these four equations in the form of a matrix."}

For each number picked it is considered a match if the casino draws that number at least once.  What is the probability for each possible outcome of 0 to 4 matches? Solution First determine the probability that the casino will drawn any of the four balls x times, including duplicates.  The probability of m such draws is combin(80,m)×(4/80)m×(76/80)20-m, where combin(80,x)=80!/(x!×(80-x)!).  The following table shows the probability of 0 to 20 total matches.

Let's let f(m,d)=probability of d distinct matches, given m total matches. It is obvious that f(0,0)=1 and f(1,1)=1. If d=2 then the probability the second matching ball drawn is the same as the first is 1/4.  So f(2,1)=0.25, and f(2,2)=0.75. If d=3 then the probability that the second and third matching balls drawn are the same as the first is (1/4)×(1/4)=1/16.  So f(3,1)=0.0625.  The probability of three different numbers is (3/4)×(2/4)=6/16=3/8=0.375.  The only other possibility is d=2, so f(3,2)=1-0.0625-0.375=0.5625. If d=4 the probability the probability of only one distinct number drawn is f(4,1)=(1/4)3=1/64.  The probability of four distinct numbers is (3/4)×(2/4)×(1/4)=6/64=3/32.  Things get a little harder with three distinct mathces.  There are 4!/(2!×1!×1!) = 12 ways you can pick one number for the one that is called twice, and two numbers called once.  Once you do that there are the same 4!/(2!×1!×1!) = 12 ways you can choose the order of those numbers called.  So out of 44=256 ways to pick 4 numbers out of 4, with replacement, 12×12=144 of them result in three distinct numbers.  So f(4,3)=144/256=0.5625.  By ommission, f(4,2)=1-f(4,1)-f(4,3)-f(4,4)=1-(1/64)-(144/256)-(3/32)=0.328125. The fun part is calculating the probability of 1 to 4 distinct matches given 5 to 20 total matches.  It is fairly obvious that there are 4 (one for each pick) ways out of 4m matches that all the number can be the same.  So the f(m,1)=4/4m = 1/4m-1. For two distinct matches there are combin(4,2)=6 ways to picks two numbers out of the four picks.  It would be incorrect to say that f(m,2)=6×(2/4)m, because it would include, multiple times, the probability of drawing only one number.  There are four possible numbers that can be drawn only once, and each of them is triple counted.  For example, of the six sets of two numbers: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), and (3,4) any given single number appears three times.  So, the probability of picking exactly two distinct numbers is 6×(2/4)m - 4×3×(1/4)m.  Let's look at the case of m=10, for example.  f(10,2)=6×(2/4)10 - 12×(1/4)10 = 0.005847931. Things get even messier with three distinct matches.  The following equations show that the probability of exactly three matches is the probability of 1-3 matches, less the probability of exactly 2 matches, less the probability of exactly one match. So f(m,3)=4×(3/4)m - 12×(2/4)m + 12×(1/4)m. For example, for 10 matches, the probability of exactly 3 distinct numbers is 4×(3/4)10 - 12×(2/4)10 + 12×(1/4)10 = 0.213546753. The probability of exactly four matches can be found by omission, subtracting the probability of 1 to 3 matches from 1.

Question Without taking it apart, how many permutations does a Rubik's Cube have? 8! � 12! � 38 � 212 = 519,024,039,293,878,000,000 Question Without taking it apart, how many permutations does a Rubik's Cube have? The six center faces of the cube are fixed.  By turning the faces all you can do is rearrange the corners and edges.  If you took the cube apart, then there would be 8!=40,320 ways to arrange the eight corners, without respect to the orientation of each piece.  Likewise, there are 12!=479,001,600 ways to arrange the 12 edges without regard to orientation. There are 3 ways each corner can be oriented, for a total of 38=6,561 corner orientations.  Likewise there are two ways each edge piece can be oriented, for a total of 212=4,096 edge orientations. So if we could take the cube apart, and rearrange the edge and corner groups, then there would be 8! × 12! × 38 × 212 = 519,024,039,293,878,000,000 possible permutations.  However, not all of these permutations can be arrived at from the starting position by rotating the faces. First, it is impossible to rotate just one corner and leave everything else the same.  No combination of turns will achieve that.  Basically, every action has to have a reaction.  If you wish to rotate one corner, it would disturb the other pieces somehow.   Likewise, it is impossible to flop just one edge piece.  For these reasons, we have to divide the number of permutations by 3 × 2 = 6. Second, it is impossible to switch two edge pieces without disturbing the rest of the cube.  This is the hardest part of this answer to explain.  All you can do with a Rubik's Cube is rotate one face at a time.  Each movement rotates four edge pieces and four corner pieces for a total of eight pieces moved.  A sequence of rotations can be represented by a number of piece movements divisible by 8.   Often a sequence of moves will result in two movements canceling each other out.  However, there will always be an even number of pieces moved with any sequence of rotations.  To swap two edge pieces would be one movement, an odd number, which can not be achieved with the sum of any set of even numbers.  Mathematicians would call this a parity problem.  So we have to divide by another 2 because two edge pieces cannot be swapped without other pieces being disturbed. So there are 3 × 2 × 2 = 12 possible groups of Rubik's Cube permutations.  If you disassembled a Rubik's Cube and put it back together randomly, there is a 1 in 12 chance that it would be solvable.  So the total number of permutations in a Rubik's Cube is 8! × 12! × 38 × 212 / 12 = 43,252,003,274,489,900,000.  If you had seven billion monkeys, about the human world population, playing randomly with the Rubik's cube, at a rate of one rotation per second, a cube will pass through the solved position on average once every 196 years."}

Question Joe puts his canoe in the river and starts paddling upstream. After a mile his hat falls in the river. Ten minutes later he realizes his hat is missing and immediately paddles downstream to retrieve it. He catches up to it at the same place he launched his canoe in the first place. What is the speed of the river current? If Joe paddles upstream and them downstream the same amount of time in both directions then his effort paddling in both directions an equal amount of time would cancel out. In other words, he would end up in the same place if he floated the whole time. We know he paddled upstream for ten minutes. So, after paddling downstream for another ten minutes he would end up in the same spot as he would had he floated for 20 minutes. We also know from the problem that in this same 20 minutes the hat floated one mile. So if the hat travels a mile in 20 minutes then it would travel three miles in an hour, for a speed of 3 m.ph.. Let: p=paddling speed in still water.\nc=current of the water.\nd=distance Joe paddled upstream since his hat fell out of the canoe. Recall that distance = rate * time. Consider the unknown distance Joe went upstream since his hat fell out: (1)\td=(p-c)*(1/6) This is because his net speed is the paddling speed less the current speed. We know he paddled without his hat upstream for 1/6 of an hour. We're also given that it took the same time for the hat to float downriver a mile as it took for Joe to travel d miles upstream and 1+d miles downstream. Let's set up an equation, balancing for time. (2)\tTime for hat to float one mile downstream = Time for Joe to travel d miles upstream + Time for Joe to travel 1+d times downstream. Time for hat to float one mile downstream = one mile/rate of current = 1/c. Time for Joe to travel d miles upstream = 1/6 (in hours), as provided in the question. Time for Joe to travel 1+d times downstream = distance Joe traveled downstream / rate Joe traveled downstream = [1 + (1/6)*(p-c) ]/ (p+c). The distance is the one mile the hat floated in the river + the (1/6)*(p-c) from equation (1). Joe�s speed going downstream is p+c, which is the sum of his paddling speed and current speed. Now we�re ready to solve for equation (2) 1/c = (1/6) + [1 + (1/6)*(p-c) ]/ (p+c)\n1/c = (1/6) + (6+p-c)/(6p+6c) \n6/c = 1 + (6+p-c)/(p+c) Multiplying both sides by 6.\n6/c = (p+c)/(p+c) + (6+p-c)/(p+c) Finding a common denominator \n6/c = (6+2p)/(p+c)\n6p + 6c = 6c + 2pc\n6p = 2pc\n3=c \nSo the current is 3 miles per hour."}

Player X Strategy: Player Y Strategy after a bet: The expected value of X is $0.10. My method of solving this problem comes from The Mathematics of Poker by Bill Chen and Jerrod Ankenman. First, we have to come up with a structure of the strategy for both players, without knowing yet the specifics.  In this case, X should obviously raise above a certain point.  Call it x2. Second, X should also bluff below a certain point, call it x1. With anything above x1 and below x2, X should check. Y is the last to act, so there is no opportunity to bluff.  He should simply fold below a certain point, and raise above it.  Call that point y1. The crux of their solution is to find indifference points where each player perceives the same expected value between two options. Let�s look at this problem as an example. Next, we must decide which number will be greater, x1 or y1. It seems obvious to me that X will bluff only with a pretty low probability.  Meanwhile, Y fold after a raise fairly often.  So, based on common sense, I assume that x1 Now we're ready to get our hands dirty with some math. Let's start by finding an equation for x1. We do this by examining the possible outcomes for all possible values of Y, and how much X will win whether he bluffs or checks with exactly x1 points. To be more specific, Here is a table the lays out the expected win by bluffing and checking if X has exactly X1, according to the value of Y1. The sum of the expected value column is -2x1+3y1-1.  As stated above, we wish to set x1 to a value where the player is indifferent between bluffing and checking.  So, we should set this expected value equation of the gain by bluff equal to zero.  In other words, -2x1+3y1-1 = 0. Next, do the same thing, solving for x2.  I will go right to the expected value table, which shows the expected value of raising, as opposed to checking, according to the value of Y. Setting the sum of the expected value column equal to 0 we get 2x2-y1-1=0. Next, we do a table for y1, showing the expected gain by calling, as opposed to checking, for every possible value of X. Setting the sum of the expected value column equal to 0 we get 3x1+x2-1=0. Now we have three equations and three unknowns.  Again they are: -2x1+3y1-1=0 \n2x2-y1-1=0 \n3x1+x2-1=0 With a little matrix algebra we can solve for x1, x2, and y1 as follows: x1=0.1\nx2=0.7\ny1=0.4 In other words, X should raise with less than 0.1 or more than 0.7, otherwise check.  Assuming X raises, Y should fold with 0.4 or less, otherwise call. The next question is what is the expected value for X if both players follow this strategy.  To answer that question, let's consider how much X wins according to every significant grouping of X and Y. Next, here is the probability of each combination of X and Y. Finally, here is the expected value of the how much X will win for each combination, which is equal to the product of the win and the probability. The sum of each cell in this table is 0.1.  So, assuming the ante is $1 per player, X can expect to win 10 ¢ per hand."}

Here are the values for these indifference points. Assuming the ante is $1 per player, x can expect to lose 5.55556 ¢ per hand. My method of solving this problem comes from The Mathematics of Poker by Bill Chen and Jerrod Ankenman. First, we have to come up with a structure of the strategy for both players, without knowing yet the specifics.  Let's define some variables to this strategy as follows. Player x should be indifferent to checking and bluffing at x1.  Let's take a look at how much x would win or lose both ways according to the value of y.  The \"difference\" column shows the benefit to bluffing if x has exactly x1, and y has a value in the specified range.  The \"expected value\" column shows the expected amount y can expect to win by bluffing, which is the product of the \"difference\" column and the probability that y has a value in the specified range. The sum of the expected value column is 3y2-1.  As stated above, we wish to set x1 to a value where the player is indifferent between bluffing and checking.  So, we should set this expected value equation of the gain by bluff equal to zero.  In other words, 3y2-1 = 0. Next, do the same thing, solving for x2.  I will go right to the expected value table, which shows the expected value of calling, as opposed to foldling, according to the value of Y. Setting the sum of the expected value column equal to 0 we get 3y1+y3-1=0. Next, do the same thing, solving for x3.  I will go right to the expected value table, which shows the expected value of raising, as opposed to checking, according to the value of Y. Setting the sum of the expected value column equal to 0 we get -y1-y2+y3=0. Next, we do a table for y1, showing the expected gain by bluffing, as opposed to checking, for every possible value of X. Setting the sum of the expected value column equal to 0 we get 3x2-x3-2y1=0. Next, we do a table for y2, showing the expected gain by calling, as opposed to folding, for every possible value of X. Setting the sum of the expected value column equal to 0 we get 3x1+x3-1=0. Next, we do a table for y3, showing the expected gain by raising, as opposed to checking, for every possible value of X. Setting the sum of the expected value column equal to 0 we get -x2-x3+2y3=0. Now we have six equations and six unknowns.

Assuming x bets or bluffs, then y should fold with 0 to 0.333333 and call with 0.333333 to 1.0. If x checks, then y should bluff with 0.0 to 0.166667, check with 0.166667 to 0.500000, and bet with 0.500000 to 1.0. Assuming x checks, and y bets, then x should fold with 0 to 0.333333 and call with 0.333333 to 1.0 (same strategy as y when forced to fold or call).

{"id": "prob_216", "type": "math", "difficulty": "0", "title": "Expected rolls with two dice", "content": "What is the expected number of rolls to attain every total from 2 to 12 with two six-sided dice? The answer is 61.217385. This question was asked at TwoPlusTwo.com, and was answered correctly by BruceZ. The following solution is the same method as that of BruceZ, who deserves proper credit. It is a difficult answer, so pay attention. First, consider the expected number of rolls to obtain a total of two. The probability of a two is 1/36, so it would take 36 rolls on average to get the first 2. Next, consider the expected number of rolls to get both a two and three. We already know it will take 36 rolls, on average, to get the two. If the three is obtained while waiting for the two, then no additional rolls will be needed for the 3. However, if not, the dice will have to be rolled more to get the three. The probability of a three is 1/18, so it would take on average 18 additional rolls to get the three, if the two came first. Given that there is 1 way to roll the two, and 2 ways to roll the three, the chances of the two being rolled first are 1/(1+2) = 1/3. So, there is a 1/3 chance we'll need the extra 18 rolls to get the three. Thus, the expected number of rolls to get both a two and three are 36+(1/3)×18 = 42. Next, consider how many more rolls you will need for a four as well. By the time you roll the two and three, if you didn't get a four yet, then you will have to roll the dice 12 more times, on average, to get one. This is because the probability of a four is 1/12. What is the probability of getting the four before achieving the two and three? First, let's review a common rule of probability for when A and B are not mutually exclusive: pr(A or B) = pr(A) + pr(B) - pr(A and B) You subtract pr(A and B) because that contingency is double counted in pr(A) + pr(B). So, pr(4 before 2 or 3) = pr(4 before 2) + pr(4 before 3) - pr(4 before 2 and 3) = (3/4)+(3/5)-(3/6) = 0.85. The probability of not getting the four along the way to the two and three is 1.0 - 0.85 = 0.15. So, there is a 15% chance of needing the extra 12 rolls. Thus, the expected number of rolls to get a two, three, and four is 42 + 0.15�12 = 43.8. Next, consider how many more rolls you will need for a five as well. By the time you roll the two to four, if you didn't get a five yet, then you will have to roll the dice 9 more times, on average, to get one, because the probability of a five is 4/36 = 1/9. What is the probability of getting the five before achieving the two, three, or four? The general rule is: pr (A or B or C) = pr(A) + pr(B) + pr(C) - pr(A and B) - pr(A and C) - pr(B and C) + pr(A and B and C) So, pr(5 before 2 or 3 or 4) = pr(5 before 2)+pr(5 before 3)+pr(5 before 4)-pr(5 before 2 and 3)-pr(5 before 2 and 4)-pr(5 before 3 and 4)+pr(5 before 2, 3, and 4) = (4/5)+(4/6)+(4/7)-(4/7)-(4/8)-(4/9)+(4/10) = 83/90. The probability of not getting the four along the way to the two to four is 1 - 83/90 = 7/90. So, there is a 7.78% chance of needing the extra 7.2 rolls. Thus, the expected number of rolls to get a two, three, four, and five is 43.8 + (7/90)�9 = 44.5. Continue with the same logic, for totals of six to twelve. The number of calculations required for finding the probability of getting the next number before it is needed as the last number roughly doubles each time. By the time you get to the twelve, you will have to do 1,023 calculations. Here is the general rule for pr(A or B or C or ... or Z) pr(A or B or C or ... or Z) = \n       pr(A) + pr(B) + ... + pr(Z)\n     - pr (A and B) - pr(A and C) - ... - pr(Y and Z) Subtract the probability of every combination of two events\n     + pr (A and B and C) + pr(A and B and D) + ... + pr(X and Y and Z) Add the probability of every combination of three events\n     - pr (A and B and C and D) - pr(A and B and C and E) - ... - pr(W and X and Y and Z) Subtract the probability of every combination of four events Then keep repeating, remembering to add probability for odd number events and to subtract probabilities for an even number of events. This obviously gets tedious for large numbers of possible events, practically necessitating a spreadsheet or computer program. The following table shows the the expected number for each step along the way. For example, 36 to get a two, 42 to get a two and three. The lower right cell shows the expected number of rolls to get all 11 totals is 61.217385. This question was raised and discussed in the forum of my companion site Wizard of Vegas."}

If this isn't obvious to you, then you probably should be attempting an easier problem. First, let's calculate the probability of winning by standing. Second, let's calculate the probability of winning by switching. Setting the expected value of standing and switching equal, we get xy = 3/8. Next, solve for y using the same method.  Forgive me if I don't through the details this time.  Again, using simple geometry or integral calculus, you'll find the probability of player 2 winning by standing at y is (y-x)/(1-x).  By the same method, the probability of player 2 winning by switching at y is [(1-x)2/2]/(1-x). Setting the two equations equal and doing some algebra we get x2 - 2y + 1 = 0.

There is some Nash equilibrium to be found between the two players.  Let: To begin, we must accept that y>x.  Player 1 is going to be conservative about switching because he has to double his bet if he does.  So, with a number around 0.5 he is better off to cut his losses and stick with it rather than double his bet and go against player 2 with a random card.  Meanwhile, player 2 can be more aggressive because he can switch for free.  With a number around 0.5, player 2 is apt to switch because he knows player 1 will have a number with an average over 0.5, because player 1 had the opportunity to switch out of the a bad number. First, let's find x.  We do so by finding the value of x where the expected value of standing and switching are equal. At x, the expected value of standing is y*(2x-1)-(1-x).  The expected value of switching at x is -2*y*(1-y). Setting the two values equal to each other we get  : (1) 2*y^2 - 2xy - 2y + 1 = 0. Second, let's find y.  We do so by finding the value of y where the expected value of standing and switching are equal. At y, the expected value of standing is x*(2*(2y -1)) + y - x - (1-y).  The expected value of switching at x is -2x*(1 - x). Setting the two values equal to each other we get: (2) x^2 - 2y - 4xy +2x + 1 = 0. We now have two equations and two unknowns.  We can rewrite equation (1) as: (3) x = y - 1 + 1/(2y). Substituting equation (3) into (2) gives us: (4) (2y^2 - 2y + 1)^2 - 2y*(4y^2) - 8y^2*(2y^2 - 2y + 1) + 4y*(2y^2 - 2y + 1) + 4y^2 = 0 After a lot of algebra, that reduces to: (5) 12^4 - 8y^3 - 4y^2 - 1 = 0 You can use a four-order calculator to solve for y as 0.554423955. You can plug that into equation (3) to get x = 0.456260889.

Each ferry travels at a consistent speed, although one is faster than the other. The pass each other 700 meters from the nearest shore. Upon reaching the other side, each spends 10 minutes docked. On the return trip they pass each other 400 meters from the opposite shore. How wide is the river? The answer is 1700 meters. Let's call x the distance between the two meetings points. We can ignore the 10 minutes each spends turning around and assume the turn around instantly.  This is simply obvious. At the first meeting, the two boats combined would have traveled the width of the river. At the second meeting, the two boats combined would have traveled three times the width of the river. Since both boats travel at a consistent speed, both boats would have traveled three times as far at the second meeting as the first. Let's solve for x looking at the fast boat. 3 × (time traveled until first meeting) = (time traveled until second meeting). 3 × (400+x) = 1800 + 2x. x = 600. So the total width of the river is 400+600+700 = 1700 meters. Let's call: We can ignore the 10 minutes each spends turning around and assume the turn around instantly.  This is simply obvious. We all know that distance = rate × time. Let's express this equality at the first meeting for both ferries. To reorder the above two equations: Those two expressions are equal: t1 = (x+400)/f = t1 = 700/s Let's express the distance=rate*time equality at the second meeting for both ferries. To reorder the above two equations: Those two expressions are equal: t2 = (2x+1800)/f = t1 = (x+1500)/s It would seem we have two equations and three unknowns.  However, we don't have to actually solve for f and s.  We can express the the ratio f/s two ways, as follows: f/s = (x+400)/700 = (1800+2x)/(1500+x). Cross multiply to get: x2 + 500x - 660000. The quadratic formula easily gives us x=600.  So the whole river is 700+600+400 = 1700 meters wide.

(x2 -9x + 20) ln(x2 - 15x + 55) = 0 One way this can be true is if x2 -9x + 20 = 0 Let's factor the left side. (x-4) × (x-5) = 0 So, the equation seems to be true for x = 4 and x = 5.  Let's plug them into the original equation, to make sure we don't run into a 0^0 problem. Let's do x=4 first: (42 - 15×4 + 55)(42 -9×4 + 20) = 11^0 = 1, so that's good. Let's do x=5 next: (52 - 15×5 + 55)(52 -9×5 + 20) = 5^0 = 1, so that's good too. But are there other values of x that work? We also know (or at least we should know) that ln(1) = 0. This will be true if x2 - 15x + 55 = 1. Subtract 1 from both sides: x2 - 15x + 54 = 0. Factor that: (x-9) × (x-6) = 0 So, the equation will also be true for x = 6 and x = 9.  But any other values of x? Recall that (-1)x = 1, if x is any positive integer. The original equation will be true if x2 - 15x + 55 = -1 and x2 -9x + 20 is a positive integer. First, let's try to find values where x2 - 15x + 55 = -1.  Adding one to each side: x2 - 15x + 56 = 0 Factoring: (x-7) × (x-8) = 0 We get x=7 and x=8.  Let's plug those into x2 -9x + 20, to make sure it is positive. 72 -9*7 + 20 = 6, so x=7 is good. 82 -9*8 + 20 = 12, so x=8 is good. So, there are six values for x that work:   4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

All three will locate their stand with the goal of maximizing sales for the day.  Once a spot is picked, the vendor must stay there all day.  The vendors don't trust each other, so collusion is out.  B will note the location of A and choose his location accordingly.  C will note the locations of A and B and pick his location accordingly.  Where should A set up his stand?  How much of the beach will each vendor get, assuming all follow optimal strategy.  You may assume that if a vendor is indifferent between multiple locations, then he will pick randomly. The first should go either a smidge to the left of the point 1/4 from the left end of the beach and a smidge to the right of the point 3/4 from the right end. The second vendor will pick the spot from A's two choices that A didn't pick. The third vendor will go in the middle. This will give A and B 3/8 of the beach each, and C 1/4. It stands to reason that A and B will want C to go in the middle, least he be the closest to an edge and cut them off from that section of the beach.  How far can they extend away from an edge and still keep C in the middle? Let's call x the distance from either edge that would put C indifferent between going right next to A and B but closer to an edge and the middle. At x, assuming C goes in the middle, A will get x + (0.5 - x)/2 = x/2 + 1/4 of the beach.  Same with B.  C will bet (1-2x)/2 = 1/2 - x of the beach.

A will want to pick a spot close to either edge, maximizing his space without giving another vendor the incentive to put his stand right next to his on the side close to the edge.  It is good to be close to an edge, because you get every customer between you and that edge.  Let's just say he picks the left side of the beach. B will want to do the same, but on the right side. C will pick a spot in the middle, putting D to an indifference point which side of C to go on. D will arbitrarily pick a spot between A and C or B and C. The question is how far from the edge should A and B pick? We want D to pick on either side of C.  Let's ask the question at what point would D be indifferent between going just to the left of A, between A and C, and between B and C. If A sets his stand at point x, then D would get x miles just to the left of A or (1/2-x)/2 by going between A and C or B and C.

Next, set the derivative to equal zero, to find the value of x that maximizes f(x). f'(x) = 4 - 2*0.5*2x*(x^2 - 0.25)^-0.5 = 0. \n\n2*0.5*2x*(x^2 - 0.25)^-0.5 = 4 \n\nx*(x^2 - 0.25)^-0.5 = 2 \n\nx = 2*(x^2 - 0.25)^0.5 \n\nx^2 = 4 * (x^2 -0.25) \n\n3x^2 = 1 \n\nx^2 = 1/3 \n\nx = sqrt(3)/3 Our total road length, based on a side of 1, is: 4*sqrt(3)/3 + 1 - 2*(1/3 - 1/4)^0.5 = \n\n4*sqrt(3)/3 + 2*(1/12)^0.5 = \n\n4*sqrt(3)/3 + 1 + 2*0.5*sqr(3)/3 = \n\n3*sqrt(3)/3 + 1 =~ 2.7321 So, for a side of length 200 kilometers, the answer is 200 * (3*sqrt(3)/3 + 1) =~ = 546.4102 kilometers."}
